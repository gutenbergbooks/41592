<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">What</span> is called the human interest in fiction is
doubtless more absorbing than any other, but other
legitimate sources of interest exist. The marvellous
always possesses a fascination, and justly; for while
it is neither human nature nor fact, it ministers to an
Ã¦sthetic appetite of the mind which neither fact nor
human nature can gratify. Superstition has been
well abused; but that were a sad day which should
behold the destruction in us of the quality which
keeps superstition alive. Fortunately that day
can never come&mdash;least of all under a Positivist
administration.</p>

<p>Such works as &ldquo;The Tempest,&rdquo; &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Consuelo&rdquo; show their authors at their best, because,
being obliged by the subject to soar above
the level of vulgar possibility, the writers catch a
gleam of transcendent sunlight on their wings. And
he who would mirror in his works the whole of man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
must needs include the impossible along with the
rest. Whoever has lived thoughtfully feels that there
has been something in his experience beyond what
appears in &ldquo;Tom Jones,&rdquo; &ldquo;Adam Bede,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vanity
Fair.&rdquo; They are earth without sky. I do not refer
to that goody-goody Sunday-school sky which weeps
and smirks over the mimic worlds of so many worthy
novelists, male and female; but to that unfathomed
mystery opening all around us&mdash;the sky of Shakespeare
and Dante, of Goethe and Georges Sand. A
reader with a healthy sense of justice feels that an
occasional excursion mystery-ward is no more than
he has a right to demand. And such excursions are
wholesome for literature no less than for him. For
the story-teller, sensible of the risk he runs of making
his supernatural element appear crude and ridiculous,
exerts himself to the utmost, and his style and
method purify and wax artistic under the strain.</p>

<p>These remarks must smooth the way to the
confession that in the present volume no &ldquo;human
interest&rdquo; will be found, or has been attempted. The
gist of the work (or at least of three-fourths of it)
is to show how the impossible might occur. Now,
in order to appreciate the delicate flavour of a ghost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
it is indispensable that the palate should not be
cloyed by a contemporary diet of flesh and blood.
In other words, the reality of the personages amidst
whom the disembodied spirit appears should be
insisted upon no further than is necessary to the
telling them apart; only that side of the human
figures which is most in accord with the superhuman
should be made prominent. If the writer has
managed this part of his business properly, he is
open to criticism only in so far as he may have
sinned in the way of conception and literary execution;
and upon those points he is happily spared the
necessity of pronouncing judgment. He may however
be permitted to observe that the following stories are
among the very lightest and least profound of their
class; there are no tears or terrors in them; barely
even a smile or a sigh; and, in short, their success&mdash;should
they achieve any&mdash;will be mainly due to the
fact that with such small pretensions failure would
actually become difficult.</p>

<p>One of the tales, it should be added, is a mere
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i>, the presence of which in the collection
is justifiable only on the plea that it makes believe
to be what the others are&mdash;relieving a note too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
monotonously sounded by lowering it to the key of
mockery. Possibly, nevertheless, it may turn out to
be the float which will save the weightier portion of
the cargo from going too speedily to the bottom.
All the stories have appeared, during the last four
years, in various periodicals, to the editors of which
my acknowledgments are due for leave to reproduce
them.</p>

<h2>THE LAUGHING MILL.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the pleasantest memories of my earlier days
is one of an old gabled farmhouse overlooking the
sea. It is a July afternoon, calm and hot. The sea
is pale blue and its surface glassy smooth; but the
passage of a storm somewhere to the eastward causes
long slumberous undulations to lapse shorewards.
They break upon the Devil&rsquo;s Ribs&mdash;that low black
reef about half a mile out&mdash;and the sound is borne to
our ears some seconds after the white-foam line
has marked itself against the blue and vanished.
There is a fine throb of sun-loving insects in the air,
which we may hear if we listen for it; but more
immediately audible is the guttural drawing of old
Jack Poyntz&rsquo;s meerschaum pipe, and the delicate
clicking of his sweet daughter Agatha&rsquo;s polished
knitting-needles. From within doors comes the fillip
of water and the clink of chinaware&mdash;good Mrs. Poyntz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
washing up the dinner-things. For we have just
dined, and the blessing of a good digestion is upon
all of us.</p>

<p>Yes; there we three sit, in my memory, side by
side upon the stone bench outside the farmhouse
door. The projecting eaves throw a quiet, transparent
shadow over us. Two or three venerable hens are
scratching and nestling in the hot sandy soil near
yonder corner, and conversing together in long-drawn
comfortable croakings. The fragrant smoke from
Poyntz&rsquo;s pipe-bowl circles upwards on the air, until it
takes the sunlight high over head. Truly a pleasant
time, whose peacefulness is still present with me after
so many years. I am old, who then was young; but
that July sunshine is warm in my heart to-day.</p>

<p>Poyntz was an ancient mariner&mdash;not lean and
uncanny, however; but burly, jovial, and brown;
with a huge grizzled beard spreading over his mighty
chest, a voice as deep and mellow as a sea-lion&rsquo;s, and
eyes as blue and clear as the ocean upon which they
had looked for more than sixty years. He had been
a successful sailor, had visited many lands and
brought home many cargoes, and was, in a rough
simple way, a thorough cosmopolitan. After his last
voyage he had settled down in the ancestral farmhouse,
and applied himself to agriculture. He was as
prosperous, contented, and respected a man as any in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the neighbourhood; and during the fortnight or so
that I had lodged beneath his roof, I had grown into
a hearty liking for him. While as to Agatha&mdash;ah,
it was not liking that I felt for her! Strange that
that fair, finely-moulded, queenly creature was only a
sailor&rsquo;s daughter! Much as I honoured Poyntz, I
could not help sometimes feeling surprised at it. At
all events, she was as perfect a lady as ever stepped
on high-arched feet; and I fancied that the old
mariner and his wife treated her in a manner more
befitting a distinguished visitor than a child of their
own. There was sturdy little Peter, now&mdash;he whose
brown legs were visible beneath the low spreading
bough of a scrub-oak beside the mill-stream yonder&mdash;there
could be no doubt as to <em>him</em>. But what a
brother for Agatha!</p>

<p>How well I recall her aspect, though it is more
than twenty years since that day. Her shapely head
was bound about with a turban of her bright yellow
hair, but her eyes and eyebrows were dark. Her
neck was round and slender, and supported its burden
in unconscious poses of maidenly dignity. The contours
of her figure were full, yet refined; her wrists
were small, and her hand was shaped like that
which lies on the bosom of Canova&rsquo;s Venus. Her
manners breathed simplicity and sweet composure,
yet were reserved and serious withal, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
they were tinged with a shadow of melancholy. At
such moments her hands would fall into her lap, her
head would droop a little forward, and her dark eyes
gravely fix themselves upon some sunlit sail that
flecked the pale horizon. So would she remain until,
perhaps, the sail sank below the verge, or became
invisible in shadow; then, with a sigh, the soft fetters
of her preoccupation would seem to fall away from
her. What were her thoughts during those reveries?
and why should they be sad ones? I had never
ventured to question her much as yet; her mystery
was itself a fascination.</p>

<p>One thing about her had attracted my particular
notice from the first&mdash;the curious pearl-shell necklace
that she always wore clasped round her smooth
throat. It was composed of very small shells of a
peculiar species, not found in that part of the world.
These were woven into a singular pattern of involved
curves, and were fastened with a broad gold clasp, in
the centre of which was set a large pearl. Handsome
as the ornament was, however, and becoming to its
wearer, it would not have so riveted my attention but
for a circumstance to which I must here make a
passing allusion.</p>

<p>Among my most precious possessions at that time
was a fine oil portrait of my great-grandmother, who
was a famous beauty in her day. My family, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
have said, is of Danish extraction, though the name&mdash;Feuerberg&mdash;was,
after the emigration of the elder
branch to America, translated to the present Firemount.
In my great-grandmother&rsquo;s days there had
been a bitter family quarrel; the younger brother
had attempted to cast doubts upon the legitimacy of
the firstborn, and when he failed to make good his
claim, he had fraudulently seized upon a large portion
of the inheritance and made his escape&mdash;whither was
not known, for no effort was made to pursue him. It
was believed that he went to Germany and married
there; and that afterwards he or his son had made
another remove, since which even conjecture had been
silent concerning them. But to return to the portrait.
It was a half-length, and had the quaint headdress
and costume of the period, one detail only being out of
the fashion; but this it was that had always possessed
most interest for me. It was the curious pearl-shell
necklace, woven in a strange pattern, and fastened
with a golden clasp, which was represented upon my
great-grandmother&rsquo;s statuesque bosom. This necklace
had for centuries been a family heirloom, and many
quaint traditions were connected with it. It was said
to have been given to the founder of our race by a
water-witch, or some such mythologic being; and
sundry mysterious virtues were supposed to belong to
it. Precisely what these virtues were I cannot tell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
nor does it happen to be of much consequence. One
saying only I remember&mdash;that the wearing of it would
ensure us happiness and prosperity so long as no
member of the family brought dishonour on the
name; but thereafter it would bring ruin. Now the
necklace had been handed on from one prosperous
generation to another, until the date of the quarrel
above alluded to; and then, all at once, it had disappeared;
and my great-grandmother was the last
person known to have worn it. She mentioned it
on her deathbed, and foretold that no good fortune
was to be expected for the Feuerbergs until the
sacred heirloom was recovered, and made a symbol of
the healing of the family feud.</p>

<p>The negative part of the prophecy had certainly
been verified. The elder branch of the Feuerbergs
never got over the effects of the blow inflicted upon
it by the younger brother. They gradually subsided
from their original high estate; and were at last
compelled to abandon the ancestral homestead, and
try their luck in the New World. At the time of my
birth we were in decently comfortable circumstances,
which improved upon the whole as I grew towards
manhood. I passed through college, and was afterwards
admitted to the Bar, which by-and-by afforded
me a tolerable income. But one spring I fancied
myself ailing, and resolved to try the sea air; and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it happened that I became acquainted with Jack
Poyntz, and with Agatha, and with her pearl-shell
necklace.</p>

<p>Of course, all idea of recovering the original necklace
had long ago been abandoned. It had been
conjectured that the seceding brother of old times
had appropriated it along with many other things
that did not belong to him; but there was no proof
of this, other than that its disappearance had been
simultaneous with his own. Moreover, if the fact
must be told, I had outgrown the easy credulity of
boyhood, and rather inclined to suspect that the
whole picturesque old tradition was three parts
imagination to one of truth. It might soothe my
family pride to ascribe our decadence to the loss of a
trinket, or I might excuse my indolence by declaring
that fortune was attainable only on condition of its
being found again; but if I descended to hard matter-of-fact,
as a lawyer should do, I must admit there
was nothing cross-questionable in such an old-wives&rsquo;
tale.</p>

<p>Cross-questionable or not, it will readily be conceived
that the sight of Agatha&rsquo;s pearl-shells gave me
a thrill of surprise, and deepened my interest in one
who needed no such accidental attraction to render
her irresistible. The necklace so closely resembled
the one in the portrait, that the latter might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
been painted from it. It was possible, no doubt, that
my great-grandmother&rsquo;s necklace was not unique; that
a duplicate&mdash;nay, many duplicates&mdash;existed. But it
was not upon the face of it probable, nor was I disposed
to accept any such commonplace solution of the
problem. I loved Agatha, and I loved to think (for
have I not hinted that I was romantic, though a
lawyer?)&mdash;I say it suited me to believe that the
necklace linked her, however unaccountably, with me.
It was evident that she herself looked upon it as
a most precious possession. She wore it continually,
as she might have worn a talisman, and touched it
often, twisting the golden clasp about, or following
the woven pattern with meditative finger-tips. Once,
when suddenly alarmed, I saw her grasp it quickly in
her hand, as if either seeking protection from it, or
instinctively yielding it protection; and another time,
during a storm, when a vessel was labouring in the
offing, and seemed in danger of being carried upon
the Devil&rsquo;s Ribs, I came upon her just as she kissed
the great pearl in the clasp, as a Catholic would have
kissed the crucifix to avert misfortune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water-witch! water-witch! be thy spells wholesome?&rdquo;
I said in Danish, for a knowledge of the
ancestral tongue has always been kept alive in the
family.</p>

<p>She turned round, started, and to my no small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
surprise, answered in the same language: &ldquo;Doubt
not the spell, if the danger be daunted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, seeming to recollect herself, she blushed,
and said in English: &ldquo;It was a song my old nurse
taught me. I should like to be a witch, if I might
save people from being shipwrecked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made no reply, and we stood silently watching
the struggle of the vessel with the storm for perhaps
ten minutes. At length it succeeded in tacking at
the very moment when all seemed lost, and bore
safely away. Agatha&rsquo;s eyes met mine for an instant;
there were both smiles and tears in them. She kissed
her pearl again and moved away. But my digression
has already gone farther than I intended. Let us
return to the stone bench beneath the eaves, and
the hot July sunshine.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Poyntz,&rdquo; said I, clasping my hands behind
my head, and crossing one knee over the other, &ldquo;how
happens your house to be set up directly opposite the
Devil&rsquo;s Ribs, and at least a mile and a half from the
village? It&rsquo;s well enough in summer of course, but
in winter, when the snow is on the ground, I should
think you&rsquo;d want to be nearer your butcher, not to
speak of the meeting-house.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, surely!&rdquo; answered Mr. Poyntz, taking the
pipe from his mouth, and smoothing down the great
sheaf of his beard. &ldquo;But, d&rsquo;ye see, sir, &rsquo;twas not I set
the house here, nor my father before me, and maybe
there was no butcher, nor yet no meeting-house along
in those times. And another thing, since you&rsquo;ve set
me a-going, sir; you see the lighthouse on the point
yonder?&rdquo; indicating an abrupt rocky promontory
half a mile to the right of our position, which lay
athwart the shore like a vast wall, separating us from
the little fishing hamlet on the other side. &ldquo;Ye see
the lighthouse on tip-end of Gloam&rsquo;s Point, don&rsquo;t ye?
Well, sir, old as that lighthouse looks to you now,
I, that am a deal older than you are, can remember
when &rsquo;twa&rsquo;nt there. And that brings me round to
what I was going to say. Along in those times, sir,
when there wa&rsquo;nt no regular lighthouse, but no bit
less danger of craft running ashore, they used to rig
up a sort of a jury-light, if I might so call it, in the
front of our old gable. Ye may see the fixings
now if ye steps forward a bit and look up there. Ay,
ay, every dark night, more especially every dirty
night, some of us would mount the garret shrouds,
d&rsquo;ye see, and show the lantern. And many a ship we
saved, no doubt; but they&rsquo;d come ashore once in
a while, for the best we could do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a suggestive name&mdash;Devil&rsquo;s Ribs. I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the bones of many a good man and vessel lie
swallowed up in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, surely,&rdquo; returned the ancient mariner, swathing
his head in a haze of tobacco-smoke. &ldquo;The more
since the currents and whirlpools thereabout mostly
keep back the floating bits&mdash;spars, bodies, and such
like&mdash;from getting to the beach. Whatever strikes
there, sinks there, speaking in a general way. And
forasmuch as there&rsquo;s five-and-thirty fathom clear
water there, and always a tidy bit of surf on, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
very popular work dredging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an ugly thought,&rdquo; I observed; &ldquo;a great
ship might go down there, and nothing ever be found
to show what she was or who sailed in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I happened to glance at Agatha as I made this
observation, and noticed that she paled a little and
let her hands fall in her lap, and after a few moments
she got up and entered the house, leaving Mr. Poyntz
and me to ourselves. I fancied&mdash;but I may have
been mistaken&mdash;that as she passed the threshold she
laid her finger upon the pearl-shell necklace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Agatha doesn&rsquo;t like to hear of wrecks,&rdquo; I
remarked after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why no, sir,&rdquo; said Poyntz slowly, his blue eyes
fixed upon the surf-whitened reef; &ldquo;and perhaps &rsquo;tis
natural she should not&mdash;specially those wrecks that
the Devil&rsquo;s Ribs is to blame for.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Has that necklace of hers anything to do with
it?&rdquo; I asked&mdash;though I cannot tell what possessed
me to put so inconsequent a question. Partly to
justify myself, I added: &ldquo;It looks as if it might have
been washed up out of the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poyntz threw a sharp look at me out of the corner
of his weather-eye. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve noticed the necklace,
have ye?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and ye&rsquo;ve a quick wit of your
own, as they say is the way with lawyers. Howbeit,
I think Jack Poyntz knows an honest man when he
sights him, and hoping ye&rsquo;ll excuse the freedom, sir,
methinks you are one. Now there&rsquo;s a bit of a yarn
I&rsquo;d like to spin ye&mdash;you being beknown amongst the
great gentlefolks down to New York and elsewhere&mdash;about
a wreck that once was on the Devil&rsquo;s Ribs.
Maybe some of those you do business for can throw
light upon it like; for what the ship was that was
wrecked, or whence she sailed, was never known; for
only that necklace that Agatha wears&mdash;only that
and&mdash;something else, ever came to land. Ye
guessed right, sir, d&rsquo;ye see, and in hopes of your
guessing yet more, I&rsquo;ll spin ye the yarn, leastways if
ye&rsquo;ve no objection. But afore starting, if ye&rsquo;ll kindly
allow me, sir, I&rsquo;ll load my pipe, for with me the
words come ever easier when there&rsquo;s smoke behind
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said nothing, but Poyntz saw well enough that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was very much interested, and, like all incorrigible
yarn-spinners, he found a humorous pleasure in
prolonging his hearer&rsquo;s suspense. It was five minutes
before his pipe was cleaned out, refilled, and lighted
to his satisfaction, and then, having spread out his
great arms along the back of the bench, stretched
his mighty legs in front of him, and fixed his gaze
upon the lighthouse&mdash;his favourite yarn-spinning
attitude&mdash;he appeared to wait for an inspiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long ago was it?&rdquo; I asked at length, to set
him going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it might be five-and-twenty years ago
that that wreck took place. You was hardly more
than out of your nursery then, I&rsquo;m thinking. As for
me, I was a chap of maybe forty&mdash;or maybe not
so much; my old father he had just parted his last
cable, as I might say, and I had just come in from
a voyage to the Pacific Coast for hides, and was living
in this house alone by myself. I&rsquo;d come home, sir, to
find the girl as had given me her word spliced to
another man; and so it happened that I stayed a
bachelor till after the age when many find themselves
grandads. But I wedded at last, sir, as ye see, and
never had cause to think the worse of myself for
doing it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think not, indeed,&rdquo; I assented, laughing.
But meanwhile I was telling myself that Agatha must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
be nearly twenty years old, and that if Poyntz had
wedded only at the age of a grandfather, she could
hardly be his own offspring by marriage. Were the
doubts which her aspect had already suggested to me
well founded, then? I prudently waited, in the hope
that this question likewise might find its answer in
the course of my host&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was along about that time, sir,&rdquo; Poyntz continued,
having acknowledged my compliment with a
friendly nod, &ldquo;that I first came acquainted with
Scholar Gloam, as the folks called him; him that
yonder point&rsquo;s named after, and that lived at the
Laughing Mill, over there, back of the wood. But
now I come for to think on it,&rdquo; broke off the old yarn-spinner,
pulling his meerschaum out of the corner of
his mouth and looking round at me, &ldquo;did I ever
chance to speak to ye of Scholar Gloam afore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ever did; but I always like to
hear about anything that has a picturesque nickname,
as almost everything hereabouts seems to have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hale old man laughed, and raked his brown
fingers through his spreading beard. &ldquo;In an out-of-the-way
place like this, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s few
enough things anyway, nicknames come natural.
Well, now, as touching Scholar Gloam, he died nigh
a score of years ago; leastways he knocked off living
in the body. For there be those,&rdquo; lowering his voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and wrinkling his brows, &ldquo;there be those&mdash;superstitious
like&mdash;ready to take affidavit of having seen
him, certain days in the year, a prowling round the
Laughing Mill. His grave is near by, right under the
Black Oak; and maybe the place is a bit skeery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howsoever, that don&rsquo;t concern us now. When
I knew Scholar Gloam, he was a middling-sized,
slender-built young gentleman, having queer hair not
all of the same colour, and a trick of talking to himself
in a sort of a low mumbling way, as it might be the
bubbling of water under a ship&rsquo;s stern, if ye know
what I mean, sir. He was a comely favoured man of
the pale sort, and grave and silent, though always the
gentleman in his manners, as by blood and breeding.
For the Gloams was the great family here fifty years
ago, and was landlords of most of the farms roundabout;
but they steered a bad course, as I might say,
and died out, so as Scholar Gloam was the last of &rsquo;em.
Old Harold, the Scholar&rsquo;s father, he was a reckless
devil if any man ever was; and when he died &rsquo;twas
found that Gloam Hall and all belonging thereto
must go to the auction. The only bit left was the
Laughing Mill itself, and an acre or two of land
round about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did the mill laugh at, Mr. Poyntz? its own
prosperity?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir!&rdquo; returned the burly mariner, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his head. &ldquo;I heard it laugh once, and I&rsquo;d as soon
crack jokes with Davy Jones as listen to it again.
&rsquo;Twas a mad, wild scream more than a laugh, and
like nothing human, praise goodness, that ever I
heard! There was ugly yarns about that mill, d&rsquo;ye
see; folks said as how it had killed a man, and afterwards
had got possessed with his evil spirit that
was always roaming about seeking whom it might
devour ... or maybe I&rsquo;ve got things a bit mixed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was it that was killed?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, surely,&rdquo; said Mr. Poyntz thoughtfully, &ldquo;I
should have told ye that. It was the man that was
married to old Squire Harold&rsquo;s housekeeper. And
that housekeeper, sir, when she was a young one, was
about as well-favoured a wench as a man would care
to speak with on a week day; and &rsquo;twas said,&rdquo; hitching
himself nearer to me on the bench and rumbling
in my ear, &ldquo;that the Squire had a fancy to her, and
that after a time she was married off in a hurry and
sent to live at the mill, and that her baby was born
six months from the wedding. Well, all I know is,
little enough that child looked like him as passed for
its father; and now comes the ugliest part of it. A
year after the child&rsquo;s birth the miller was found dead
one morning underneath his own mill-wheel. Seems
he&rsquo;d fallen in the mill-race by some mishap, and so
had the life crushed out of him. But bad things was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
said ... and the widow and child they went back
to the Hall, and lived there many years, till the
Squire died. The child got all his growth and training
there, and folks used to say he&rsquo;d have been more
like the Squire if he hadn&rsquo;t been most like his mother.
Well, the Squire being gone at last, and the estate all
sold saving just the mill, as I told ye, what does the
housekeeper and her son do but go back to the mill
again. The son&mdash;David he was called&mdash;was then a
likely young chap of maybe seventeen; and he took
right hold and began for to run the mill, and a very
fair profit he made out of it, taking one year with
another. And Scholar Gloam, he was living in the
mill-house along with them, having his room to himself,
and his books and instruments quite cosy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that rather an odd thing for him to do,
Mr. Poyntz, under the circumstances?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, surely; but ye must keep it in mind, sir,
that Scholar Gloam was a wondrous odd man. He&rsquo;d
been his whole life shut up with his books and
his studies, and no doubt had a vast deal of that
sort of learning; but of worldly knowledge, as I
might say, he&rsquo;d none at all whatever, no more than
a child. Little he&rsquo;d heard of his father&rsquo;s doings, be it
with the handsome housekeeper or anything else;
and little he dreamed&mdash;ye can make affidavit&mdash;that
her son had any claim to call himself his brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
though &rsquo;twas told him once afterwards, as we&rsquo;ll come
to presently. Nay, but my thought of him is, he was
a simple, honest gentleman at that time, kind of heart
and thinking ill of no one; only a bit strange and
distant, d&rsquo;ye see, as was no harm in the world for him
to be. And being quite the same thing to him
whether he lived in a palace or a mud hut, so long
as he might study his fill, why, likely he&rsquo;d an easy
enough time of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;twould have been smooth enough sailing
for the whole of them only for one thing, which is to
say as how, ever and anon, in the mid of a big run of
luck, that there mill would take on a spell of its
laughing; and with that folks would be giving it a
wide berth, and business would slack up again. It
was no use the old woman and David a swearing
that a bit of rust on the axle was the cause of it all;
for, mind ye, there was no steering round that black
fact of the old miller&rsquo;s having met his death on the
wheel; and, too, though they was never done hunting
for that bit of a rust spot, they never found it, or if
ever they thought they had, lo! there&rsquo;d be the laugh
in their faces again, so to say, the next morning.
Ay, &rsquo;twas a bad, unholy sound that, sir; but the
Scholar, strange to be told, seemed less to mind it
than anyone; the cause being, mayhap, as how he
was a wondrous absent-minded man anyway, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
only one as had never been told the true story of how
the old miller came by his end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So now, sir, having dropped ye this bit of a hint
of who Scholar Gloam was, I&rsquo;ll go on with the yarn of
the wreck on the Devil&rsquo;s Ribs and the necklace.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;But, first and foremost,&rdquo; continued Mr. Poyntz,
after having revived his failing pipe with a dozen or
so of quick whiffs, &ldquo;first and foremost I must mention
a queer habit he had&mdash;Scholar Gloam, I mean&mdash;and
by which it was as I first came acquainted with him.
As long as the sun was over the horizon line he&rsquo;d
stay indoors, behind the lock of his study door; but
at nightfall out he&rsquo;d walk, foul weather or fair, and
through the wood back yonder, down across the
rocky pasture to the sea, a trip of maybe a mile and
over. And often at midnight, as I&rsquo;ve been pulling
shorewards from the offing in my fishing dory, I&rsquo;ve
seen him standing a-top of the point, where the lighthouse
stands now, the sky being light behind him,
and he looking black, and bigger than any human
creature; and sometimes he&rsquo;d be tossing his arms
about, and shouting out some un-Christian lingo,
though there was no one there to talk to&mdash;leastways
that I could see. &rsquo;Twas a queer thing, I say, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
slender, delicate-looking gentleman like him to be out
so by night, in all weathers, seeming not to know the
difference whether it blew, or rained, or snowed, or all
three together. Some folks used for to shake their
heads over it, and say he was gone daft; others there
was (the superstitious kind, d&rsquo;ye see) would have it as
how Davy Jones, whose black bones had been the
end of many a good ship and cargo, was in the
custom of coming nightly to the point to hold parley
with him, as it might be to strike a bargain whereby
Davy should get the Scholar his estates and riches
again in change for his soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Jack Poyntz never troubled his head with
such fancies, sir; and times, when I&rsquo;d stowed my boat
away, I&rsquo;d hail him, and have him down to the house;
and sitting snug together by the kitchen fire, many a
strange yarn has he spun me, the like of which never
was heard before&mdash;leastways not outside of the books
that were hid in his library&mdash;and of which many were
writ in strange tongues as are not spoken in our
Christian times. But it&rsquo;s not for me to be repeating
of &rsquo;em now, only, as I was a-telling ye, it was such-like
things brought us acquainted; and very good
chums we were, allowing for his being a young gentleman
scholar, and me a sailor as had no great book-learning,
though knowing more of men and things
than a hundred such as him. And by the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a couple of years or so, meeting him that way off and
on, I knew him as well as ever anybody knew him&mdash;as
well, maybe, as he knew himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, things being this way, one day, about the
last week in September, it came on to blow. There
was no rain, but no moon either, and the air was
thick; and night coming on, it was as black as my
hat. It wasn&rsquo;t long afore there was a heavy sea
running, and ye could have heard the surf on them
Devil&rsquo;s Ribs five miles inland. I shipped the lantern
up in the fore gable as usual, though knowing it
couldn&rsquo;t show far in such a night; and, thinks I, see
it or not, any ship that gets caught in the tide this
weather is bound to wreck; so I&rsquo;ll hope, says I to
myself, that they&rsquo;ll give us a wide berth. Howbe,
I wasn&rsquo;t sleepy, so I loaded my pipe, and, thinks I,
I&rsquo;ll have a snug smoke and a drop of grog alongside
the kitchen fire afore turning in. No chance, thinks
I, of my Scholar happening in this night; he never
could beat up against that wind, not if he had Davy
Jones himself to pilot him. Well, there I sat for
maybe an hour, the noise of the storm getting ever
louder and louder, so at times I could hardly hear the
rattle of my spoon as I stirred up the grog in the
tumbler. Then all of a sudden there comes a knocking
at the door, quick and heavy, and up I jumps and
opens it, and lo! there was the Scholar, with no hat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and no coat, and that strange-coloured hair of his
blown up wild about his head, and his eyes wide open
and bright as a binnacle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come in, sir?&rsquo; shouts I, loud as if
I was a-hailing him at the maintop, such a noise the
wind made; &lsquo;ye&rsquo;ll get the heart and lungs blown
clean out of ye if ye stop there!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seemed like he answered me something, I
couldn&rsquo;t make out what; but he laid hold on my
sleeve with that thin white hand of his, that gripped
like a vice, as if he&rsquo;d pull me out into the storm with
him, instead of coming in to me. And by his face I
could see there was a storm within him as stirred him
more than the one without; and then he pointed
down seawards, and, thinks I, &rsquo;tis a ship he&rsquo;s seen
or heard on the Devil&rsquo;s Ribs. And though I knew
well we could no more help any poor wrecked souls
than if they was in the moon, yet it wasn&rsquo;t in me to
back out of going with him to see what there was to
see. So just laying hold of my tarpaulin and a flask
of rum, off we starts on the run, dead in the wind&rsquo;s
eye. How he managed for to scud over the ground
at that rate is more than I could make out; the wind
seemed to take no hold on him, but just let him through
easy, though all the time it was near blowing my
ears off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, down we came to the beach at last, at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
place about a cable&rsquo;s length this side of the point.
I&rsquo;d kept my man in sight up to this time by reason
of the white shirt he had on, his coat, as I told ye,
being off him, but whither gone I&rsquo;d not remembered
for to ask him. But now, all of a sudden, I found
he&rsquo;d disappeared, and all I could see was the pale
froth of the surf that came leaping up the beach, with
a sound from the black wave behind it like the going
off of a big gun. Howsoever, I presently stumbled
round the corner of a big boulder&mdash;ye may see it
yonder, sir, in a line with the face of the lighthouse
and the top of the pine stump&mdash;and there he was on
his knees beside something wrapped up and still;
and when I looked, &rsquo;twas seemingly a young girl,
about twelve to thirteen years old, with no life in her.
She had come ashore on a bit of planking, and the
Scholar he had seen her coming, and had scrambled
down from the cliff in time to haul her in and under
the lea of the boulder. How he did it the Lord only
knows, for ten men working together might have
failed in it. But there she lay, with no mark of harm
or bruise upon her, and yet (as my heart misgave me)
lifeless from the washing of the waves through which
she had voyaged to land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw &rsquo;twould be no use trying to give her
rum yet awhile, so I stoops to lift her up along
with the bit of planking that she lay upon; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Scholar Gloam he helped, though neither of us spoke,
by reason of the thundering noise of the surf and the
wind that half deafened us. It took us maybe a
quarter of an hour, and then we were at home, and
had her down before the fire, and wrapped in hot
blankets, and everything done that could be done;
and after nigh a couple of hours&rsquo; work, she moved the
least mite in the world, and fetched a sigh. With
that I sings out like I&rsquo;d come upon a chest full of
gold dollars, and says I, &lsquo;All&rsquo;s well, Scholar Gloam;
she&rsquo;s a-coming to, and she&rsquo;ll live to smile on us yet!&rsquo;
And then what does he do, sir, but just throws his
head back with a little laugh, and topples over in a
dead faint. &rsquo;Twas the exhaustion, ye must understand,
as had come on all at once after the suspense
of whether she was alive or dead was over. So there
was I with the two of &rsquo;em to doctor. Well, I soon
had the Scholar all right again; but when he saw as
how the child was a-doing well, he drops off suddenly
to sleep, being tired right out and unable for to keep
his eyes open; and I didn&rsquo;t wake him, but just threw
a blanket over him, and let him sleep it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was, maybe, half an hour after that that the
little girl spoke; she had been opening her eyes and
then shutting them several times, and wondering
where she was got to, I suppose, poor little dear.
She was pretty and white, with yellow hair and big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
blue eyes, and soft little feet and hands, and pointed
fingers; and round her neck was the pearl-shell
necklace that ye&rsquo;ve seen Agatha wearing, sir. Well,
she looked at me for a bit, and seemed like to cry,
not knowing who I was, or where she&rsquo;d got to, d&rsquo;ye
see; and then she said something, repeating it over
twice or thrice; but I couldn&rsquo;t understand her, by
reason of her speaking some foreign lingo as was
unknown to me. Howsoever, I took for granted that
it must be some of her people she was asking after;
so I pointed to the back room, and made believe as
they were in there, but asleep, and not to be disturbed
then. She believed me, poor little soul, and
presently after dropped quietly asleep, with the tears
yet under her eyelids, and the firelight flickering over
her sweet face and yellow hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I sat there between the two, for I wasn&rsquo;t
sleepy at all myself, and kept the fire alight, and my
own pipe a-going, till morning, by which time the
storm was mostly cleared off. So I got the old
lantern down from the gable, and stirred about to
get breakfast ready; and at sunrise, the two being
still sleeping, I walked out to see if so be as anything
of the wreck was visible. But the Devil&rsquo;s Ribs was
only a bank of foam, and when I came to the beach
there was naught there but a few shattered timbers
and bits of spars and rigging; whatever else there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
may have been had gone down within the whirlpool
of the Devil&rsquo;s Ribs, and would never see daylight
more; nor was there anything to tell where the
wrecked ship hailed from, or what she was, or whither
she was bound. Nay, a man might well have doubted
whether there&rsquo;d been any wreck at all; and superstitious
folks might have thought that the pretty
child we had found was a sea-nymph or a mermaid,
who had come on the shoulders of waves to bring us
good luck&mdash;or bad, maybe! Not that I&rsquo;d have ye to
think, sir, that I&rsquo;m of the superstitious kind, being
a man as has seen much of the world, and lived
a number of years in it. But &rsquo;twas a strange thing
altogether, and stranger yet was to follow, as ye shall
hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my walk I happened by the boulder where
I&rsquo;d been with the Scholar overnight, and there I
picked up a small iron box, with a big lock on it; it
was lashed to four bits of wood, so as it might float,
and I think it must have come ashore along with the
raft that brought the little girl. Just as I laid hands
on it, and cut away the lashings, I sighted one of the
villagers a-coming over the cliff path towards me. So,
not caring to be hailed at that time, I slipped the
box in the pocket of my jacket, and steered for the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And lo! there was the fair child sitting in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
chair, and the Scholar he was kneeling in front of
her, with her hands in his, and they were a-talking
together in that same foreign lingo as she had
spoken in to me; for, d&rsquo;ye see, he had learnt it all
from his books, and understood it as well as she
who was born to it. The child was a bit scared
and tearful still, and he seemed to be a-comforting
of her; and as I came in, says he, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let on
that her folks are drowned, Jack; for I&rsquo;ve told her
they&rsquo;re but borne away to another harbour, and will
return one day to claim her. So meanwhile,&rsquo; says
he, &lsquo;she&rsquo;ll come to live with me at the mill, and be my
little girl; for is she not my little girl now, since &rsquo;twas
I brought her forth from the ocean that would have
robbed her sweet young life?&rsquo; With that he kisses
her little hands, and says somewhat to her again in
her own tongue. It touched my heart to see the two
together, sir; for, d&rsquo;ye see, the Scholar had never
seemed to be aware, as I may say, of women or
children until now; he had moved through life without
seeing them or speaking to them, save at times in
an absent, dreamy sort of a way, as though they were
in different worlds. But now he was full of earnestness
and a kind of joyful trembling surprise, as one
who had all of a sudden opened his eyes to a great
treasure, and was delighting in it all the more for that
he had been unknowing of it before. He was all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
all a changed man, and softened, and waked up
inside, so that his eyes seemed to be a-seeing the
things that was round him, and not things in a
dream; and methought there was a difference in his
voice, too; it was deeper and tenderer like, and made
you feel as how he had grown to be a man more than
a scholar. I thought he was as a ship that had long
been lingering in cold dark waters, baffled with winds
that set towards no pleasant harbour, but which had
at last found its sails filled with a fair fresh breeze, as
was blowing her to warm southern seas and tropic
islands full of heat and life. Ye&rsquo;ll maybe laugh, sir,
to hear an old sailor talk like this; but surely I had
loved the man, and pitied him, too, for his loneliness;
and it touched me, as I said, to see that he had
found a good thing in the world, and could feel the
happiness of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pretty soon, Jack,&rsquo; says he again, &lsquo;ye must help
me carry her to the mill this morning, before the
village folks are astir; and don&rsquo;t tell them that she&rsquo;s
there, or whence she came. She&rsquo;s my own, and her
past is all gone for ever; God has sent her to me for
my own. I shall make her love me as I now love
her, and no other shall have any part in her. I
will be to her all that she has lost, and more; and
I will cherish her always and make her happy. And
when the village folks find out that I have her (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
soon of course they must), they shall be told that she
is a good fairy come to bring me fortune and delight.
I&rsquo;d say that she rose up one morning out of the deep
clear pool just above the mill-race; and that though
appearing as a human being, she is in very truth
not mortal, but has consented to live with me so
long as I continue worthy of her companionship.
But when the time comes&mdash;which God forbid it
ever should!&mdash;that I prove unworthy, then shall
she vanish back to her natural abode, and I be more
desolate than before she came. And as for this
necklace,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;it is a talisman; and should fate
ever separate us, yet this be left me, &rsquo;twill be a pledge
that&rsquo;....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The yarn broke off abruptly enough. Poyntz
and I had both started to our feet, our eyes and
ears straining towards the mill-stream, where little
Peter had during the last hour been quietly fishing.
The sound of a quick scramble, a heavy plunge, and
simultaneously a lusty scream, had sharply broken
the repose of the summer afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the brat has toppled in!&rdquo; cried Poyntz,
the sunburnt ruddiness of his complexion turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to a tawny sallow hue. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t swim; haste
ye lower down, sir; I&rsquo;ll to the pool; but if as he&rsquo;s
carried over the fall, ye&rsquo;ll stop him at the rapid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had already set off on a run towards the
bank, and we now separated in accordance with
Poyntz&rsquo;s suggestion. I saw no more of the latter,
being wholly absorbed in carrying out my part of
the programme; and in a few moments I was standing
panting beside the rushing water, trying to select
the best point from which to take my plunge. Just
then I heard a swift rustling step behind me, and
there was Agatha, her lovely face and eyes aglow
with terrified excitement. Then it passed through
my mind that she had always evinced a particular
tenderness and affection for poor little Peter; and
at the thought I must confess that my resolve to
save him at all risks became tenfold as strong as it
had been before.</p>

<p>It was all a whirl and confusion; and only by
comparing notes afterwards did we make out the
order of events. Master Peter, it seems, after much
unfruitful angling, had at last succeeded in hooking
a huge trout, and straightway had lost first his
mental and then his bodily balance. The fish being
fairly on the hook, and pulling hard, the little man
had rather chosen to go in after it, rod and all, than
save himself at the cost of losing it. His scream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
however, had startled not only his father and myself
but Agatha and his mother likewise; and the latter
had followed her husband, as Agatha did me. When
Poyntz reached the brink of the pool, the young
fisherman had just risen for the second time, and was
circling helplessly in the eddy. Poyntz sprang forward;
but his foot catching in a vine, he fell prone,
his head in the water and the rest of his body on dry
land.</p>

<p>Before he could disentangle himself (an operation
which the well-meant but too convulsive efforts of
Mrs. Poyntz only served to retard) the child had
drifted into the current and was carried over the fall.
It was now that Agatha and I first caught sight of
him. She pressed impulsively forward, and had I
not retained her would have leaped into the headlong
rapids herself. As I caught her arm, I felt rather
than saw her glance at me, as though measuring my
ability to do what must be done. Apparently her
decision was in my favour, for she stepped back;
and an instant after I was staggering breast deep
in the boiling stream, watching the swift but topsy-turvy
onset of Master Peter. Down he swept; and
to make a long story short, I succeeded in catching
hold of him without losing my footing, and thereby
in saving his life and my own. Agatha helping from
the bank, we were soon landed high and dry, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
rather, very wet. Then ensued a great and indescribable
hullaballo, wherein the first distinguishable
words burst from Mr. Poyntz:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look ye here, wife!&rdquo; cried he, laughing and
weeping in the same breath, &ldquo;look if the lad hasn&rsquo;t
stuck to his fish through it all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it proved; Peter had rivalled the childish
exploit of his predecessor, stout little Kit North.
There was the rod, still lightly gripped in his small
fist; and a three-pound trout was flapping and
gasping at the end of the line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s but a chip of the old block, Mr. Poyntz,&rdquo;
said I, when the shouts that greeted the discovery
had somewhat subsided. &ldquo;What is that sticking in
the corner of your mouth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old mariner put up his hand and took the
thing out, and after staring at it for a moment in
comical dismay, he burst into a laugh, in which
everybody joined. It was the stem of his well-loved
meerschaum, held unconsciously between his teeth
throughout the entire turmoil; the bowl had probably
been snapped off when he fell on the brink of the
pool. So we all retraced our way to the house,
the trout resting triumphantly in Peter&rsquo;s arms, who
was himself carried by his father. Agatha and I
walked side by side; neither spoke to the other,
and I knew not what thoughts were in her mind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
but for my own part I had never been more light
of heart, and I regarded Peter and his trout as the
best friends that ever lover had. My achievement had
been trifling enough, Heaven knows; but such as it
was, it had been done before her eyes, and partly
at least for her sake. When we had reached the
house-door, and the others had passed in before us,
she paused on the threshold and turned to me,
smiling, with her finger upon the necklace-clasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I kissed it to save you ... and Peter!&rdquo; she
added hastily, and with a light in her dark eyes that
was half mischievous, half earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now that we&rsquo;re saved, I suppose you are
going to kiss ... Peter?&rdquo; I dared to reply, for my
ducking had given me courage.</p>

<p>She blushed, but looked straight at me; and the
next moment was gone into the house, leaving me
uncertain whether I had gone too far or not far
enough. But, ah! happy Peter. A few bruises, and
the involuntary swallowing of a gallon or two of
water, were the extent of his injuries; while his
blessings were beyond estimation. When I came
downstairs half an hour later, after changing my
clothes, I found him bundled up in an old pea-jacket
of his father&rsquo;s, and sitting in Agatha&rsquo;s arms. He was
watching his mother clean the big trout, the prize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of his valour; and as I passed by, Agatha glanced up
at me and kissed him!</p>

<p>I stole out by the kitchen-door and looked about
for Mr. Poyntz; for his yarn had, for several reasons,
begun to interest me exceedingly, and I was most
anxious to hear the end of it. But he was nowhere
to be seen; he had gone off to attend to something
on the farm, and would as likely as not be absent till
supper-time. It was a long time till then, and meanwhile
I was without anything to amuse me. My
mind was restless and excited, and I would have
been thankful for any distraction. Nothing turned
up, however, and at length&mdash;without being at the
pains even to notice what direction I was taking&mdash;I
set off on an objectless tramp, and was soon out
of sight of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>I had plenty to think about&mdash;so much, indeed,
that I could think coherently about nothing. Ideas
crowded incongruously upon one another, now this
one and now that catching my attention for a
moment, and then receding to the background.
From the picture of my late adventure in the mill-stream,
I slid to a review of Agatha&mdash;my relations
with her; did she care for me? had my lucky exploit
really advantaged me? and ought I to have stolen
a kiss upon the doorstep? Instead of considering
these questions, I was pondering the tale which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Poyntz had begun to tell. Was it all true? would
he ever finish it? and what would be its upshot?
But now the pearl-shell necklace ruled
my thoughts. Was it possibly the same as that
which my great-grandmother had lost? and if
so, would Agatha be likely to know anything
about it? The next moment a vision of Scholar
Gloam had risen before me. How had he come to
die, and be buried beneath the Black Oak? and why
was the old mill considered haunted? David&mdash;the
handsome housekeeper&rsquo;s son&mdash;what had become of
him? and, above all, what had been the fate of
the little sea-nymph? Then the necklace once more&mdash;how
came Agatha to attach such talismanic virtues
to it? and was not her doing so evidence that she
must know its ancient history? Again, was Agatha
Poyntz&rsquo;s own daughter? and if so, who and what
had been her mother? for she must be the child
of a union prior to that which had resulted in Peter.
The speculation gave place in turn to the idea of
the mill-wheel possessed by the devil, or by the
soul of the murdered miller&mdash;Poyntz had seemed
uncertain which. Had its &ldquo;laugh&rdquo; really been so
terrible? or had not an originally harmless, if disagreeable
noise, acquired a supernatural horror only
because listened to across a gap of twenty years?
Ah well, what matter to me were all these idle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
unanswerable queries? Behind all things&mdash;before
all things, I seemed to meet the sweet fascination
of Agatha&rsquo;s dark eyes, and to catch the gleam of
her yellow hair. Yes, ever and ever, as the pendulum
swings outwards and returns, does my thought come
back to Agatha!</p>

<p>Immersed in such disjointed musings, I had
journeyed on I know not how long, when all at once
I became conscious, so to speak, of the outward
world, and looked up and on all sides of me. Where
was I? In no place certainly that I had ever visited
before. The sea was nowhere visible; the surface
of the ground was rocky and irregular, and in nearly
every direction the view was shut in by thick growths
of pine, birch, and oak. From beyond a clump of
the latter, southward from where I stood, I thought I
detected the noise of falling water; and glancing
eastwards, I could trace the course of a stream which
was itself unseen, by the hedge of stunted timber that
fringed its banks. The aspect of the neighbourhood
was wild and remote; it seemed to lie apart from
men&rsquo;s ways; and certainly he would have been an
unsocial spirit who should have chosen such a spot
to live in. On the other hand, anyone in search
of a good place to do a murder in, or hold a
witch meeting, need not have looked farther. A
corpse might lie amongst these rocks and bushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for twenty years without a chance of being discovered;
and ghost and witches might scream their
eeriest unheard by mortal ear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I walked on to the other side of the
clump of oak trees, when I suddenly found myself
gazing on a scene that involuntarily brought me to a
standstill.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>I was now standing on the bank of a stream
which, coming from the west, took its course past
my feet eastwards. For some distance its approach
was between gradually rising walls of rock, which
were highest just where I stood. Thence was a
precipitous descent into a small gorge about one
hundred paces in length, whose steep sides opened
out towards the east, their meeting-point being my
present station. Through the natural gateway which
it had cut for itself in the face of the precipice, the
stream fell cataract-wise into a deep pool below,
whence overflowing it rushed down a rugged incline,
and, having leapt another fall, raced along the middle
of the little glen, and so hurried with foam and noise
onward to the sea.</p>

<p>There were vestiges of a rude bridge, long
since broken down, across the natural gateway just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
mentioned; and I even fancied that I could detect
traces of an ancient footpath which had its beginning
somewhere in the west, and, crossing the stream at
this point, had then clambered down the slope to
the bottom of the gorge. The bridge had not been
entirely of stone; but a stout plank had probably
spanned the flood, secured at either end by rough
masonry. It must have been a ticklish passage
without a handrail, for a false step, followed by a
plunge over the cataract, would have been almost
certain death. If Master Peter had tumbled in here
instead of at the other pool miles lower down, not
Poyntz, nor Agatha, nor I, nor all the luck in the
world could have got him out alive.</p>

<p>The hollow of the gorge was much overgrown
with bushes and brambles, and along the margin
of the noisy stream the grass was high and rank.
At the opening of the little valley farthest from
where I stood rose an immense oak-tree&mdash;the only
tree of anything like its size to be seen within a
mile&mdash;whose wide-spreading branches cast a deep
shadow on the earth beneath. So thickly clustered
the leaves on the stalwart boughs, and so dark
was their tint of green, the whole great tree seemed
to have been steeped in night. The gorge, though
full of sunlight and verdure, and vocal with the
splash of the cataracts, wrought on me even at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the first glance an impression of loneliness and
desolation. The blue sky seemed farther away from
this than from other parts of the earth&rsquo;s surface, and
methought the sun shone upon it rather in mockery
than in love.</p>

<p>Nearly midway down the hollow, and just under
the second cataract, hung a huge water-wheel. It
hung there motionless, and plainly many a year had
passed since it had revolved upon its ponderous axle.
It was built of wood, on a clumsy and old-fashioned
model, and had become so blackened by age and
weather that one might have fancied it charred by
fire. Its parts were fastened together with great
nails and clamps of iron, the strength of which,
however, was now but a deceptive appearance, for the
metal was eaten away by red rust, so that a hearty
shake would probably have caused the whole structure
to tumble into ruin. The rain and snow of unrecorded
seasons had spread the rust in streaks and
blotches over the swarthy rottenness of the woodwork
until I could almost have believed it dabbled with
unsightly stains of blood.</p>

<p>Side by side with these ominous discolorations,
however, were growing patches of tender green moss;
and thick tufts of grass bent gracefully over the heavy
rim of the wheel, where it impended above the
rushing water. A delicate vine of convolvulus had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
become rooted somewhere above, and had wreathed
itself in and out among the rigid spokes. It seemed
as though Nature were striving, with but partial
success, to win back to her own fresh bosom this
gaunt relic of man&rsquo;s handiwork. With but partial
success; for all the magic of her beautiful adornments
could not annul the odd feeling of repulsion&mdash;or
was it perverted fascination?&mdash;with which this
sullen wheel began to affect me. I know not how to
interpret, even to my own mind, the nature of this
impression. Solitary as I stood there, I yet could
not rid myself of the notion that I was not (in the
ordinary sense of the word) alone. That wheel&mdash;there
was something about it more than belongs to
mere negative brute matter. It seemed not devoid
of a low and evil form of consciousness&mdash;almost of
personality. I recognised the morbid extravagance
of the idea at the same time that I was powerless
to do away with it. Everyone, probably, has had
some similar experience; and the fact that reason
cannot account for the sensation does not lessen its
impressiveness.</p>

<p>The wheel had caught my eye from the first, and,
as it were, commanded my main attention. But
after a few minutes I looked away from it, not
without a conscious effort of will, and gave a closer
examination to other objects in the glen. The mill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to which the wheel appertained stood on the right
bank of the stream, but was now little more than
a heap of ruins. The wooden part was wholly
decayed, and the stone foundations were displaced
and shattered, and covered with weeds and rubbish.
A few paces farther back, huddled against the
southern acclivity of the gorge, was the carcase of
a dismantled and deserted house. The roof had
fallen in, the window frames and sashes were gone,
and the lifeless rooms stood open to the air. The
stone walls had formerly been overlaid with plaster,
but this had mostly fallen away, and what patches
remained here and there were stained with greenish
mould. A tall clump of barberry bushes was
growing just within the threshold of the doorway,
as if to dispute the entrance of any chance intruder;
and a vigorous plantation of some species of
yellow flowers was waving above the remains of the
chimney. The spectacle was in every respect forlorn
and depressing; no barren desert, that had never
been trodden by the foot of man, could have so
repelled and saddened the observer. Man feels no
sympathy for what has never known life; but that
which once has lived and now is dead, yet retains
in death some semblance of its extinct vitality,&mdash;that
it is which brings the true feeling of desolation home
to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>After a time I climbed cautiously down from my
coign of vantage, and making my way between loose
stones and tangled shrubbery, I passed the black
wheel and arrived at length beneath the shadow of
the great oak. And here, for the first time, I began
to feel very weary, with a weariness as much of the
mind as of the body. In fact, what with my adventure
with Peter, my long walk, and the excitement
produced by old Jack Poyntz&rsquo;s strange yarn, I had
been through a good deal for an invalid, and had
earned the right to a little rest. Looking about me
for a seat, my eye fell upon a small mound which lay
between me and the base of the oak, with a bit of
gray stone jutting out from one end of it. It might
once have been a bench; at all events it would serve
my turn, so I threw myself down at full length and
pillowed my head and shoulders against it. As I
lay, my face was turned towards the open end of the
gorge, and away from the house and mill-wheel.
These, however, dwelt in my memory; and on closing
my eyes, I found that the scene of the ruin stood
distinctly before my mental sight, more weird than
the reality, because the phantom sunshine appeared
pallid and ineffective.</p>

<p>The sound of a breeze stirring amid the thick
leaves over my head mingled with the gurgle of the
stream, until it seemed as if some voice were speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in a low minor key&mdash;a tone without passion and
without hope. As I listened, and fancifully attempted
to fashion words and sentences out of the inarticulate
murmur, that odd sensation of not being alone (which
had all along been hovering about me) suddenly
intensified itself to the pitch of conviction. Sitting
up with something of a start, I glanced nervously
towards the mill, and at once had the pleasure of
seeing my conviction justified. The figure of a man
was actually standing on the opposite side of the
stream, one hand resting upon the wheel, while he
fixed upon me the gaze of a pair of black eyes. He
had probably been there from the first, or if not
precisely there, then in the near vicinity; there were
hiding-places enough amongst the ruins. Nevertheless
I felt an unreasonable anger against him. He
had come upon me unawares; and a surprise, if it be
not agreeable, is apt to be very much the reverse.</p>

<p>He was a person of medium height, perhaps a
little below it, and was clad in a shabby old-fashioned
coat and small-clothes. He wore no hat, and the
black hair which grew thickly upon his high head was
curiously variegated with large patches of white. His
countenance showed refinement and sensitiveness
but the expression stamped upon it was singularly
painful. I cannot better describe it than by saying
that it seemed to indicate loss, loss beyond remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
either in this world or the next. Its effect upon me
resembled that wrought by the desolate house, but
was more potent, because humanised. The man
seemed beyond middle-age, judging from the furrows
on his brow and the stoop on his shoulders; and
yet there was a kind of immaturity in his aspect.
He was as one whose intellectual much outweighed
his actual experience; who had dwelt amidst theories
and eschewed reality. Such a combination of age
and youth needs a strong seasoning of sincerity and
simplicity to make it palatable; but in the present
case these qualities were wanting, and instead there
was an indefinable flavour of moral perversion.</p>

<p>When we had regarded each other for several
moments, the man crossed the mill-race and advanced
towards me, making a gesture of greeting with his
hand. His manner was well-bred and quiet, and
left no doubt that he was a gentleman; notwithstanding
which I felt an antipathy against him, and
was half-minded to admonish him that his presence
was unwelcome. That I did not yield to this
impulse was due, perhaps, less to courtesy than to
the strong sentiment of curiosity with which the
stranger had already inspired me. In other words,
he was a magnet that attracted me with one pole
while repelling me with the other; and the attraction
was, for the moment, the stronger force of the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>At this juncture it occurred to me&mdash;I know not
how I had failed to think of it before&mdash;that these
ruins must be what was left of the Laughing Mill,
to which Poyntz had made allusion in his interrupted
yarn. The recognition gave me a thrill of a kind not
altogether agreeable; I was glad that the sun shone
instead of the moon. Nor did I, under these changed
conditions, so much regret the presence of a companion.
I was in a nervous and abnormal state, and
though far from superstitious&mdash;no lawyer could venture
to be that&mdash;I preferred society to solitude in a
place which had the reputation of being haunted. It
was healthier to converse about such follies&mdash;even
with an unsympathetic interlocutor&mdash;than to brood
over them in private. This old-fashioned personage,
moreover, had the air of being familiar with the neighbourhood;
perhaps he was in the habit of coming
here, and could give me some information about its
former inhabitants&mdash;Scholar Gloam and the rest. I
repented my former rude intentions, and resolved to
be friends with him, and draw him out. Accordingly
I returned his salute, and commanded my features to
an expression of affability.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Within about three paces of me he stopped, and
passed his hand two or three times through the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and white masses of his hair. He had the air of
trying to rouse himself from a mood of painful preoccupation.
At length he spoke in a faint, unaccented
tone, like a voice heard far off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want your sympathy,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have we met before?&rdquo; I asked, rather taken
aback. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t remember&mdash;but I believe I&rsquo;ve
been half asleep, and am hardly awake yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly, his black eyes curiously
perusing my face. &ldquo;You have chosen an ill place to
sleep in,&rdquo; he remarked after a pause. &ldquo;Many a year
have I sought repose there&mdash;in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed? Well, I came here quite by accident,
and judging by the aspect of the place, I shouldn&rsquo;t
have supposed it would have been often visited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, few come hither now; but as
many as do so are liable to meet with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked more narrowly at my queer companion,
and all at once the thought struck me, the man is
mad! Yes, it must be so. How otherwise could
the strangeness of his appearance, behaviour, and
conversation be accounted for? He did not look
dangerous, probably he was incapable of doing
harm, and therefore permitted to wander about
as he liked. In the moral atmosphere of these
ruins he was sensible of somewhat congenial to his
own forlornness, and hence haunted them rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
than any more cheerful spot. Certainly, this was an
appropriate haunt for a madman&mdash;for one whose
mind had fallen into that ugliest chaos which was
once beauty and order. But I liked the spectacle of
mental even less than that of material decay; and
though the poor gentleman had asked me for my
sympathy, I scarcely knew how to give it to him.</p>

<p>By I know not what faculty of divination, he
appeared to suspect what was passing in my
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not mad,&rdquo; he said quietly, but with a
tremor of the finely-cut though irresolute lips. &ldquo;I
am not mad, I have passed beyond insanity. Let me
sit down here and talk to you. Nay&mdash;do not rise!
Recline as you were doing, and close your eyes if you
will; I need only your ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While speaking thus he passed behind me, and
apparently seated himself at the foot of the oak-tree,
outside of my range of vision. But no sooner was
he out of plain sight, than I was seized with an odd
fantasy that he had actually vanished into thin air,
and that were I to look round, I should not find him.
His voice only was left, and even that now seemed
unearthly. Was it a human voice? and not rather
the rustling of leaves and the gurgling of water,
translated by my feverish imagination into weird
speech?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You were dreaming,&rdquo; resumed the voice; &ldquo;what
dreams had you of the wheel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What dreams had I of the wheel?&rdquo; I repeated,
leaning back on the mound, and clasping my hands
across my eyes. Here was another instance of my
new friend&rsquo;s insight. How had he known that the
wheel was in my thoughts at all! Yet it was true
that I had given rein to all sorts of fanciful speculations
concerning it, and was now, moreover, quite in
the mood to give them utterance. And what better
auditor could I desire than a madman, whom the
wildest extravagance could not disconcert, nor the
most palpable absurdities annoy? The opportunity
was too fair to lose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What dreamt I of the wheel?&rdquo; I exclaimed
again: &ldquo;I dreamt it was the mighty Wheel of Fortune,
who, weary of trundling it about the world, had
left it here amidst the sedge and spray of the waterfall.
Henceforth, therefore, there shall be no more
ups and downs in life, but mankind shall move for
ever across one level plain, unchecked by darkness
and uncheered by light!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you have it thus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;not I! Come back, fair goddess! come
back and wrest thy wheel from amidst those clinging
vines and brambles&mdash;the arms wherewith reluctant
nature strives to hold it back! Bring it forth once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
again upon the dusty road, and turn it as you go, lest
our sluggish hearts forget to beat, and we cease to
draw the very breath of life, and our souls, torpid and
uninspired, grovel earthwards, nor dream of climbing
higher than themselves! Bring forth thy wheel, and
turn it for ever even as the world turns; for thy
fickleness is the life of our lives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Methinks the wheel of misfortune were its truer
title; for it turns ever between a fool above and a
corpse beneath; and the laugh of madness sounds
before, and behind is a track of blood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, name it how you will; since all of human
joy and grief, and life and death, have clustered
round its course, as the moss and the vines cluster
about it now. See how Nature seeks to make the
awful symbol of destiny into a plaything for her own
beautiful idleness! How fearlessly the light and
shadow rest upon it! Yet it is bloodstained. Those
rank ferns bend and peer in quest of some lurking
horror? What is it? I feel its influence upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, you feel it!&rdquo; murmured my unseen companion,
tremulously; &ldquo;and how could you help but
feel it? Do not the tragedies of human life instil
their essence into the things we call inanimate? You
have shuddered when handling the rack and the Iron
Virgin of the Inquisition, and felt faint at the sight
of the guillotine and the gallows. You were awed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
by an evil influence breathed from the actual wood
and iron&mdash;not by the mere knowledge of ghastly
scenes in which they had borne a part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came the influence there?&rdquo; I asked,
humouring his grotesque theory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That which has existed in an atmosphere of
revenge, hatred, and despair, becomes at last impregnated
with a malignant intelligence derived from
them; an intelligence both devilish in itself and able
to endow you with its own deformity. And if you
hold not aloof from it, you shall surely be destroyed&mdash;in
soul, if not in body likewise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do we feel this influence unless aware beforehand
that it is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fix your thought constantly upon yonder wheel,&rdquo;
was the reply, &ldquo;and mark if it does not answer you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still with my hands clasped across my eyes, I
concentrated my mind as directed, and presently felt
my veins crawl with a slow chill of dismay&mdash;a chill
which deprived me of control over my faculties,
while awakening them to unnatural activity. That
the wheel had a conscious personality, instinct with
evil, seemed no longer open to doubt. Now the
plash and gurgle of the water changed to the stealthy
drip of blood; and I shrank from the breeze that
moved my hair as from a pestilential breath. Was
I going mad too? My will seemed to falter; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
tremor which I could not repress passed through me
from head to foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, you feel it,&rdquo; murmured the voice again.
&ldquo;You are answered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By a determined effort I regained command of
myself. Perhaps it was none too soon. Nothing
is easier than to indulge this morbid vein, and few
indulgences, I believe, are more perilous. With my
change of mood came a change of tone; I cast
aside the hysteric style, and adopted one more
brusque and matter-of-fact, to which the reaction
from sentimentality may have added a touch of
asperity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We are overdoing this
folly. I know well enough what place this is;
Mr. Poyntz began to tell me about it this afternoon.
An amusing story&mdash;all about the Laughing Mill, and
the fellow who was drowned, and the nymph of the
pearl-shell necklace. You see, I know what I am
talking about! But the tale broke off in the middle;
perhaps you can finish it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is you who must finish it!&rdquo; returned the
other. &ldquo;But I want your sympathy; so let me tell
my part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;by all means. When I know
you better, I shall be better able to sympathise with
you. As to my finishing the story, I think I&rsquo;m more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
likely to succeed as a listener than as a narrator;
however, if it must be so, I&rsquo;ll give it the best ending
I can. And I do sympathise with you already,&rdquo; I
added, after a pause, in a less flippant tone. &ldquo;I am
a man, and I believe in human brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My eccentric companion made no rejoinder,
though I fancied he gave a sigh. Presently he began
to speak in the same evenly-pitched, far-away voice
that he had used throughout. The effect was rather
as of a weary reader reading from a book than as
of one who talks spontaneously, there was no hesitation,
no rise and fall, no fire, no faltering. Yet
the recital moved me more deeply than if it had
been delivered with impassioned eloquence. Through
the sad colourless medium I seemed to behold the
direct movement of events, and almost to take part
in them. Moreover, as the narrator proceeded, the
notion more than once possessed me that his words
reached my ears from some inward source&mdash;that I
was merely thinking the things I seemed to hear.
His tone was so attuned to the desolateness of the
surroundings, as to appear like the mystic interpretation
of their significance, such as might result
from intense brooding over them. Indeed, taking
into consideration all that I had seen, heard, and
fancied that day, I almost believe I could have fallen
asleep and dreamed just such a story as he told me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Certainly no dream could have been stranger than
the things he told.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>They brought the yellow-haired little maiden to
the mill (ran the story), and Gloam called her Swanhilda.
Jael, the old housekeeper, looked at her
sharply, and asked what good such a little creature
could be among poor people? the girl was of no use
herself, and would only hinder those who had to
work.</p>

<p>Gloam answered, &ldquo;Heaven has sent her to us.
She shall be our inspiration, and the symbol of our
good. Treat her with reverence, and tenderly, as you
would treat the best and purest aspiration of your
heart. If we wrong her, it will be our deadliest sin.
If we cherish her, the sins we have committed may
be forgiven us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter, at all events,&rdquo;
said Jael. &ldquo;Look at the shape of her hands and
feet! No, she never worked, nor did her mother
before her. Well, maybe her family will come after
her some day, and pay us well for taking care of her.
Or who knows but she may turn out heiress to some
great estate, when she grows up? If that were so....
David, son, come hither. See&mdash;she&rsquo;s a pretty
little thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Handsome David stooped down and took the
child&rsquo;s small soft hand. &ldquo;And so she is&mdash;a little
beauty!&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking into her blue eyes.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t speak English, eh? That&rsquo;s a pity; but live
and learn. Right glad am I that you brought her
here, sir,&rdquo; he added to Gloam. &ldquo;Where did you pick
her up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the rainbow after the storm,&rdquo; Gloam answered,
smiling. &ldquo;But I shall not teach her English.
Let her speak only the language which she has
brought with her.&rdquo; And he led the child away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may do for him,&rdquo; muttered David, &ldquo;but it
won&rsquo;t do for me. He can talk with her and I can&rsquo;t;
so if he won&rsquo;t teach her English I will. Devil take
me if she isn&rsquo;t a sweet little fairy; and she&rsquo;s quite
enchanted the Scholar already. He&rsquo;s a changed man
since yesterday. But he shan&rsquo;t have all the fun to
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks thirteen, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; said Jael.
&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be a child much longer, David. Why,
come three years or so, she&rsquo;ll be old enough to be
married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, old woman; but I shall be too old to marry
her,&rdquo; he answered, with a keen look and a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, son, she&rsquo;s a lady, and good enough to
mate with any man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your notion, and likely enough it&rsquo;s true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
But good blood isn&rsquo;t all I want&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got that already,
thanks to your good looks; what I want and haven&rsquo;t
got is money. And Miss Swanhilda, pretty as she is,
has less money even than I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she has relations&mdash;rich relations; her own
father and mother may be alive for all we know. If
she was saved off a ship where all the rest were lost,
of course there&rsquo;ll be no telling for some time to come.
But it&rsquo;s worth waiting for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did no papers come ashore&mdash;nothing to help
identify her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked Poyntz that,&rdquo; said Jael, &ldquo;and so far as
I can make out, I think there hasn&rsquo;t been anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll make sure of that next time I go over.
We might advertise in the foreign papers after
awhile. A right pretty little thing she is, and no
mistake. But I&rsquo;m not a-going to run any risks, old
woman. Supposing I was to get tied down to her
for life, and then find out that she&rsquo;d got nothing, what
would I do then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of supposing any such thing,
David. As if you couldn&rsquo;t make the girl fond of you
so as she wouldn&rsquo;t marry any but you; then you&rsquo;d
have her safe, and if all turned out well, &rsquo;twould be
time enough to put the ring on her finger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s about the idea, I suppose. Well, the
Scholar&rsquo;s got the start of us now; and &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t do to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
let him see what we&rsquo;re up to; luckily he never did
see what&rsquo;s going on under his nose. By-the-way,
that&rsquo;s a quaint bit of a necklace the child wears;
mayhaps that&rsquo;ll help us to find out something&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, with an oath, and he and
his mother stood listening, pale-faced. His eyes were
angry, but terror lurked in those of the woman.</p>

<p>A strange jarring sound filled the air; it seemed
to come from every side, and screamed harshly into
the listeners&rsquo; ears. If a fiend had burst into a long
fit of malignant laughter close at hand the effect
could not have been more hateful and discordant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The laugh again!&rdquo; David muttered between his
teeth. &ldquo;It would be just our luck if it scared our best
customer away. Devil take me if I don&rsquo;t begin to
believe it is the soul of that cursed husband of yours,
that you treated so affectionately. I&rsquo;ll swear there&rsquo;s
not a spot of rust on the machinery as big as a pin&rsquo;s
head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, son, don&rsquo;t look that way at me,&rdquo; said the
woman, in a shaken voice. &ldquo;I would prevent it if I
could; what can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might jump in and follow your husband;
that&rsquo;s what he wants, I suppose,&rdquo; returned the son,
angrily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that wronged him, not I; and as
long as you&rsquo;re here we&rsquo;ll have no luck. That&rsquo;s the
long and short of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The laugh had died away, and Jael, pressing her
hand above her heart, turned aside and passed out.
She loved her son, and would have shed her blood
for him; but this was not the first time he had
spoken thus.</p>

<p>After she was gone, David stood at the window,
biting his lips and muttering to himself. Suddenly
he heard Gloam&rsquo;s step behind him, and looked round
in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that noise?&rdquo; Gloam asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing new, sir. The same old story.
Something wrong with the wheel again, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember no such sound before,&rdquo; said Gloam,
excitedly. &ldquo;It is hideous, like the shriek of an
evil spirit. Let it never come again; it frightens
Swanhilda, and comes between us like a prophecy of
woe. Let it never come again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have taken to hearing through her ears
and feeling through her senses&mdash;that&rsquo;s all the matter,&rdquo;
answered David, smiling. &ldquo;It sounds bad to you
because it makes her head ache. As to stopping it,
I&rsquo;d do so, and gladly, if I but knew how. It loses
us half our custom, for folks say the devil&rsquo;s at the
bottom of it, sure enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a wicked sound!&rdquo; exclaimed Gloam again,
&ldquo;full of mockery and bitterness. Swanhilda was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
born to hear divine harmonies, and she will leave us
if we greet her with such hideous discord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was born to take her chance with the rest
of the world, Mr. Gloam,&rdquo; replied the younger man,
in a harder tone. Then he smiled again and added,
in his muttering way, as he left the room, &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get
used to it fast enough, never fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a long time passed without the recurrence of
the hateful sound, and meanwhile Swanhilda was
recovering from her first melancholy and home-sickness.
Gloam had told her that she would see
her father and mother again some day, and by
degrees her anxiety calmed down to a quiet and not
uncheerful expectation. She seemed to know little
of the history of her family, or else was averse from
discussing it; for amidst all her winning sweetness
and pure sincerity she retained a maidenly reserve
and dignity not lightly to be overcome. But the
guileless fascination which she unconsciously exercised
upon all she met was impossible to resist. She
gladdened all eyes and hearts, and the mill became
a storehouse of beauty and gladness as well as of
grain and meal. People came from all the surrounding
neighbourhood to see Scholar Gloam&rsquo;s
water-nymph; and at last, when the Laughing Mill
was mentioned, they thought of Swanhilda&rsquo;s airy
merriment&mdash;not of the ill-omened sound that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
first given it that name, but was already being fast
forgotten. So the prosperity of handsome David
increased, and was greater than it had ever been
before; he had as many customers as the mill could
supply, and bade fair, in the course of years, to
become a wealthy man. He and Jael treated the
little water-nymph with every kindness, as well
they might; and what Gloam had said seemed likely
to come true&mdash;that she would be the means of their
regeneration.</p>

<p>And Gloam himself was as a man transfigured.
He lived no longer amidst his books, but made
himself free to all; and the neighbours wondered to
find him so genial and gladsome. He and Swanhilda
were constantly together; they played and laughed
like children; they went on long rambles hand-in-hand;
in winter they pelted each other with snow-balls;
in summer and autumn they gathered flowers
and berries and nuts. He treated her with the most
reverent and entire affection; he was ready to
sacrifice anything for her sake, to give her anything&mdash;unless
it were, perhaps, the freedom to be to
another all that she was to him. But apparently
she was well content. Gloam was the only one who
spoke her language, and the only one, therefore, with
whom she could converse unrestrainedly. He would
not teach her English, and if others attempted to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
so it was without his knowledge or consent. He
believed, it may be, that no one but himself could
appreciate her full worth, and thought it would be a
kind of desecration to let another approach her too
nearly. Certainly they were happy together. That
part of his nature to which she appealed was not
less youthful than she was herself; and in her society
he felt himself immortally young. He forgot that
there were lines upon his brow, and that his figure
was bent, and that his hair had begun to be prematurely
white. And he doubted not that as he felt
so he seemed to her.</p>

<p>Was his confidence justified? Had this child
who was just beginning to be a young woman,
penetration to see the fresh soul within the imperfect
body? A more experienced man would have had
misgivings, knowing that young women are apt to
judge by appearances, and to be more swayed by
downright power and passion than by abstract right
and beauty. But Gloam&rsquo;s experience had not taught
him this. He did not dream that she could ever
learn to deceive him, or to give him less than the first
place in her heart. But he dreamed that some day,
distant perhaps, at least indefinite&mdash;they would be
married. By all rights they belonged to each other,
and when they had played their childish games to
the end, and had wearied of them, then would they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
enter upon that new phase of life. Meanwhile he
would not speak to her of the deeper love, lest she
should be startled, and the frankness of their present
intercourse be impaired. But women have been lost
ere now through fear of startling them.</p>

<p>So more than two years slipped away, and the
child Swanhilda had grown to be a tall and graceful
maiden; which seemed half a miracle, so quickly
had the time passed. Her blue eyes had waxed
larger and deeper, and in moments of excitement
they became almost black. Her hair was yellow as
an evening cloud; her face and bearing full of life
and warmth. Her nature was strengthening and
expanding; she was beginning to measure herself
against her associates. Though so gentle, she was
all untamed; no one had ever mastered or controlled
her. She knew neither her own strength nor weakness,
but the time approached when she would seek
to know them. Every woman is both weaker and
stronger than she believes, and it is well for her,
when the trial comes, if her strength be not the
betrayer of her weakness.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>At this point in the story the voice of the narrator
grew fainter and then made a pause. I still kept my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
reclining position, with my hands clasped above my
closed eyes. In fact, it would have required a greater
effort than I at the moment cared to make to have
sat up and looked about me. The sun, I knew, had
already sunk below the crest of the slope; the gorge
lay in shadow, and beneath the oak it was almost
dark. As I lay waiting for the tale to recommence,
the sombre influence of the wheel asserted itself more
strongly than ever. There it loomed, in my imagination,
black, grim, and portentous. Its huge spokes
stretched out like rigid arms, and the long grass
which streamed along the gurgling water resembled
the hair of a drowned woman&rsquo;s head.... But now
the voice began again.</p>

<p>One summer afternoon Gloam and Swanhilda
were sitting on the wooden bench beside the mill,
watching the heavy revolutions of the great wheel.
They were alone. David was in the mill-room
finishing the day&rsquo;s work, and Jael was preparing
supper in the kitchen. For several minutes neither
of them had spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; said Swanhilda at last, using
her native tongue, &ldquo;the first day I came here, how
there came a terrible sound that made me miserably
frightened? I have never heard it since then. What
was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a rusty axle; at least, so I suppose. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
careless David had forgotten to oil it properly. But
I gave him such a scolding that there has been no
more trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;David is not careless&mdash;he works very hard, and
I love him,&rdquo; retorted Swanhilda, tossing back her
yellow hair. &ldquo;Besides, such a noise could not be
made by an axle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may like David, but you mustn&rsquo;t love him;
you are a little princess, and he is only the housekeeper&rsquo;s
son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the difference between loving and
liking?&rdquo; inquired Swanhilda, folding her hands in
her lap, and turning round on her companion.</p>

<p>He took her hand and answered, &ldquo;I shall teach
you that when you are older.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so young as you think. I am old
enough to be taught now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; said Gloam, shaking his head and
laughing; &ldquo;you are nothing but a child yet. There
is plenty of time, little water-nymph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will not teach me, I&rsquo;ll find someone else
who will teach me. I will ask David; he has taught
me some things already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He? What have you learnt from him?&rdquo; cried
Gloam.</p>

<p>Swanhilda hesitated. &ldquo;I should not have said
that&mdash;but it&rsquo;s nothing, only that I am learning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
speak English. He didn&rsquo;t want you to know until
I was quite perfect, so as to make it a surprise to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had no right to do it. Why should you
learn to speak with anyone but me?&rdquo; exclaimed
Gloam passionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I belong to you?&rdquo; demanded
Swanhilda, lifting her head in half-earnest, half-laughing
defiance. &ldquo;No; I am my own, and there
are other places besides this in the world, and other
people. I will go back to my own country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Swanhilda,&rdquo; said Gloam, his voice husky
with dismay, &ldquo;you will never leave us? I cannot
live without you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, if you are unkind to me.... Well, then,
you must not be angry because David taught me
English; and you must let him teach me the
difference between liking and loving; I&rsquo;m sure he
knows what it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not ask him&mdash;do not ask him! That is my
right; no one can take it from me! I saved you,
Swanhilda; I brought you back to life, and that new
life belongs to me!&rdquo; The hand that held hers had
turned cold, and he was pale and trembling. &ldquo;I have
kept you for myself; I have given up my own life&mdash;the
life that I used to live&mdash;for you. But I cannot
return to it, if you leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not ask you to give it up,&rdquo; she returned,
waywardly. Then she relented, and said, &ldquo;Well, you
may teach me about loving, if you want to. Only,
afterwards, you must let me love anyone I please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gloam looked upon her for several moments, his
black eyes lingering over every line of her face and
figure. &ldquo;You belong to me,&rdquo; he repeated at last.
&ldquo;If you left me for another, I should wish that your
pearl-shells had drawn you down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before he could finish uttering the thought that
was in his heart, the words were drowned in a throbbing
yell as of demoniac laughter. The evil spirit of the
wheel, after biding its time so long in silence, had
seemingly leapt exultingly into life at the first premonition
of meditated wrong. Swanhilda shuddered,
and hid her face in her hands. David thrust his head
out of the mill-room window, and saw Gloam make
a gesture of rage and defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he muttered to himself, &ldquo;so the children&rsquo;s
games are over, are they? Can it be the devil&rsquo;s game
that my beloved brother thinks of beginning now?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Another year passed, and again a man and a
woman were sitting together on the bench beside the
mill. It was night, and a few stars twinkled between
the rifts of cloud overhead. The gorge was so dark
that the mill-stream gurgled past invisibly, save where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
occasionally a rising eddy caught the dim starlight.
The tall wheel, motionless now, and only discernible
as a blacker imprint on the darkness, lurked like a
secret enemy in ambush. The man&rsquo;s arm was clasped
round the woman&rsquo;s waist; her head rested on his
shoulder, and her soft fingers were playing with the
pearl-shell necklace that encircled her neck. They
spoke together in whispers, as though fearful of being
overheard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You silly little goose!&rdquo; the man said; &ldquo;a few
months ago nothing would make you happy but
learning what love was; and now you have found out
you must ever be whimpering and paling. Why,
what are you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I am happy in loving you, David,&rdquo;
was the tremulous answer; &ldquo;but must lovers always
hide their love, and pretend before others that they do
not feel it? When I first dreamed of love, it seemed
to me like the blue sky and the sunshine, and the
songs of birds; but our love is secret and silent, like
the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! nonsense, and so much the better! Our
love is nobody&rsquo;s business but our own, my lass. You
wouldn&rsquo;t have Gloam find it out, would you, and part
us? What! have you forgotten the fit he was in at
my teaching you English a year ago? He wants
you all to himself, the old miser! You weren&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
happier with him than you have been with me, were
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, David,&rdquo; whispered the girl, clinging to him,
&ldquo;that was so different! I was happy, then, like a
wave on the beach in summer. I had no deep
thoughts, and my heart never beat as you make it
beat, and my breath never came in long sighs as it
does often now. Gloam used to say that he had
brought me back from death to life; but it was not
so. I lived first when I loved you. And the old
happiness was not real happiness, for there was no
sadness in it; it never made me cry, as this does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew her to him with a little laugh. &ldquo;When
you&rsquo;ve lived a little more and got used to it, you&rsquo;ll stop
sighing and crying, and be as bright and saucy as
you were with Gloam. But you won&rsquo;t want to tell
him ... eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hid her face on his shoulder. &ldquo;Oh no, no,
no; I could not; I should feel ashamed. But why
do I feel ashamed, David? Is not loving right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right? to be sure it is. Nothing more so!
And the pleasantest kind of right, too, to my thinking.
Eh, little one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;David, I have heard&mdash;are not people who love
each other married&mdash;at least sometimes? and after
that they are not afraid, or sad, or ashamed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A smile hovered on David&rsquo;s handsome lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
&ldquo;Married, yes, stupid people get married. Timid
folks, who are afraid to manage their own affairs, and
can&rsquo;t be easy till they&rsquo;ve called in the parson to help
them out. They&rsquo;re the folks that don&rsquo;t love each
other right down hard, as you and I do. They&rsquo;re
suspicious, and afraid of being left in the lurch; so
they stand up in a church and tie themselves together
by a troublesome knot they call marriage. No, no;
we&rsquo;ve nothing to do with that; we&rsquo;re much better off
as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my father and mother were married, and
they were not suspicious,&rdquo; ventured Swanhilda again,
after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ay, they were married,&rdquo; assented David;
adding, half to himself, &ldquo;and if they were alive, too,
and anxious to fill a son-in-law&rsquo;s pockets, I&rsquo;d open
mine, and gladly. But my father and mother were
not married,&rdquo; he resumed to Swanhilda, with another
smile, &ldquo;so you see we&rsquo;ve a good example either
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made no reply, but lifted her head from his
shoulder and sat twisting the necklace between her
restless fingers, her eyes fixed absently on the darkness.
The clasps of the necklace came unawares
apart, and it slipped from her bosom to the ground.
She uttered a little cry, and stood up with her hands
clasped, all of a tremble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have lost it!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;David, some harm
is coming to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! here it is, as good as ever.&rdquo; He
picked it up as he spoke, and drawing her down
beside him, fastened it again round her neck, and
then kissed her face and lips. &ldquo;There, there, you&rsquo;re
all right. Did you think it was dropped in the mill-race?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some harm is coming,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;It has
never fallen from me since my mother put it on my
shoulders, and said it would keep me from being
hurt or drowned, but that I must never part from it.
But I trust you, oh, my love! I trust you. Something
seems wrong somehow; I have given you all
myself....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lean close up to me, little one; rest that
soft little cheek of yours against mine, and have
done with crying now, or I&rsquo;ll think you mean to
melt all away and leave me; and what would I do
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned and clasped her arms around him with
a kind of fierceness. &ldquo;I leave you, David? Oh&mdash;ha,
ha, ha! Oh, but you must never leave me, my love&mdash;love&mdash;love!
Oh, what should I do if you were to
leave me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, girl; hush! you&rsquo;ll rouse the house, laughing
and crying in the same minute! Don&rsquo;t you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
I won&rsquo;t leave you? There&mdash;hush! You&rsquo;ll wake
Gloam else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He loved me, too; he wouldn&rsquo;t leave me;
but he thought I wasn&rsquo;t old enough&mdash;not old
enough, ha, ha!... David, does God know about
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not enough to trouble Him much, I expect,&rdquo;
said the young man, with a short laugh. &ldquo;If anything
knows about us, it&rsquo;s the old wheel there, waiting
like a black devil to carry us off. Come, we must
creep back to the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rose, Swanhilda stood before him, her sweet
sad face glimmering shadowy pale through the darkness.
&ldquo;Say, &lsquo;I love you, Swanhilda, and I will never
leave you!&rsquo;&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>He hesitated, laughed, stroked her hair, and stooping,
gazed deep into her eyes, as on the day when
they first met. Did his heart falter for a moment,
realising how utterly she was his own? &ldquo;You trusted
me just now,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;are you getting suspicious
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I am afraid&mdash;always afraid now. When
you are not with me, I am afraid of everyone I meet;
I think they will see our secret in my eyes. When I
lie alone at night I am afraid to pray to God, as I
used to do. What is it? Why do I feel so? It
must be that we have done some wrong. My poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
love! have I made you do any wrong? I would
rather be dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little darling&mdash;no! You couldn&rsquo;t do wrong if
you tried. There is no wrong&mdash;I swear there isn&rsquo;t.
Listen, now in your ear: I love you, Swanhilda, and
I will never leave you! Satisfied now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Low as the words were whispered, they were
heard beyond the stars, and stamped themselves upon
the eternal records. But their only palpable witness
was the mill wheel. A log of wood, carried over the
fall, came forcibly in contact with the low-impending
rim. It swung the heavy structure partly round upon
its axle. And straightway, upon the hollow night,
echoed a faint yet appalling sound as of jeering
laughter. Slowly it died away, and silence closed in
once more, like darkness after a midnight lightning
flash. But it vibrated still in the startled hearts of
the man and the woman, who crept so stealthily back
to the house, and vanished in the blackness of the
doorway, and it revisited their unquiet dreams.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Summer and winter came and went, and were
followed by a gloomy and dismal spring. The late-lying
snow was dissolved by heavy rains so that the
mill stream was swollen beyond precedent, and rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
thundering through the gorge with the force of a full-grown
cataract. But the mill was idle, and the wheel
stood still. None came for flour now, nor to bring
grist; for many a week all work had been foregone.</p>

<p>Yet the house was not deserted. An elderly
woman, with a forbidding face that had once been
handsome, moved to and fro behind the windows;
and a man, bent and feeble, with strangely-grizzled
hair, sat motionless for hours at a time in his study-chair.
Sometimes, in his loneliness, he would set
his teeth edge to edge, and clench his thin hands
desperately, and utter an inarticulate sound of
menace. But at a certain hour of the evening he
would arise and walk with noiseless steps to the door
of a darkened chamber. There he would pause and
lean and listen. Presently from within would be
heard the shrill, petulant crying of an infant, and
anon the voice of its young mother, sad and tender,
soothing and pathetic: &ldquo;Baby, baby, don&rsquo;t cry; hush,
hush, hush! father will come to us soon; he will
come, he will come! he loves us and will never leave
us; hush, hush, hush!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these sounds the pallid visage of the man
would quiver and darken, and he would press his
clenched hands upon his breast. Returning at length
to his study, he got upon his knees and stretched his
arms upwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;God&mdash;God of evil or of good, whichever you are&mdash;give
my enemy into my power! Let my curse
work upon him till it destroy him: let my eyes see
him perish! He has robbed me of my love, and
my hope, and my salvation; he has defiled and
dishonoured that which was mine; he has made my
life a desert and an abomination! Yet I would live,
and suffer all this and more, if he might perish by
my curse, body and soul, for ever! Grant me this,
God or Devil, and after do with me what you will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was his prayer. But he never entered the
darkened chamber where the child and its young
mother lay; he never looked upon them or spoke
to them, nor did his heart forgive them. He could
not forgive till he had had revenge. Since that hour
in which he had first learnt the truth, and with
hysteric fury had sprung at the seducer&rsquo;s throat, his
soul had been empoisoned against them and all the
world. He was possessed by that devil to which he
prayed, and good was evil to him.</p>

<p>One day he was standing in a kind of stupor at
his window staring out at the black mill-wheel, which
was now the only object in the world with which he
felt himself in sympathy. There came a knock at
the door, and Jael, the housekeeper, entered. Since
the calamity which had befallen, her manner towards
Gloam had undergone a change. She had before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
exercised a kind of authority over him, such as a
compact and unsympathetic nature easily acquires
over one of wider culture but more sensitive than
itself. But Gloam had become more terrible in
his desolation than a less naturally gentle man would
have been; and Jael feared him. She felt that he
might murder her; and minded her steps, lest in
some sudden paroxysm he should leap out upon her.</p>

<p>She advanced a little way into the room, and
stopped. He did not turn, or show that he was
aware of her presence. After a few moments she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master, he is coming back; David&rsquo;s coming
home again, sir. He&rsquo;s going to make it all right with
Swanhilda&mdash;he means to marry her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gloam did not stir; but as Jael watched him
narrowly, she fancied that his limbs and body slowly
stiffened, until they became quite rigid; only his
head had a slight shivering motion. The woman
shrank back a step, with a feeling of alarm.</p>

<p>It seemed a long while before Gloam spoke, and
the same slight, involuntary shiver pervaded his voice.
He still kept his face carefully averted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;David coming back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I had a message from him this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To ... marry her!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, sir; he&rsquo;ll make an honest woman
of her. What he has done has laid heavy on his
conscience ever since. And so he says he hopes
you&rsquo;ll forgive and forget, and that we&rsquo;ll all prosper
and be happy in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gloam&rsquo;s chest began to heave, and he folded
his arms tightly across it. There was another long
pause, as though he feared to trust his voice to speak.
Finally the words came between his shut teeth:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When&mdash;when&mdash;when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you mean, when will he be here, sir? Well,
he was expecting to reach the next town late this
afternoon; and from there he&rsquo;d foot it over here;
and that wouldn&rsquo;t bring him here till nigh midnight.
But likely he&rsquo;ll wait over, and get here to-morrow
morning. Luckily though there&rsquo;s a moon to-night, to
show him where to step, in case he comes right on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gloam unfolded his arms, and raising his hands to
his head, passed them several times slowly through
his hair; staring downwards, meanwhile, at the wheel.
The rigidity had passed away, and he seemed to be
recovering from the agitation into which the first
shock of the news had thrown him. Jael&rsquo;s mind was
a good deal relieved at the absence of any signs of
hostility on his part against David; and she was just
about withdrawing, when Gloam turned quickly about
and stepped after her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>For the first time in the interview she now saw
his face; and the sight so far startled her firm nerves
as to draw from her a short low cry. It was not that
the face was pallid, furrowed, and wasted; it had been
all that from the first; but what appalled her was the
ghastly expression of the mouth and eyes. It was
not a smile, unless an evil spirit smiles, foreseeing the
destruction of its victim. Evil it was&mdash;delightedly
evil, like the triumph of long-baffled hate. It was
a cruel, hungry, debased expression, hideously at
variance with the passionate and ill-regulated but
refined character of the man. It suggested the idea
that Gloam was possessed by a strange spirit, more
potent and more wicked than his own, which commanded
his body to what uses it pleased, in spite of
all that he could do.</p>

<p>For it was evident that he himself understood the
cause of Jael&rsquo;s dismay; and he made a violent effort
to drive the awful look out of his face. So far from
succeeding, however, he was forced to break out into
a frantic laugh, which echoed shrilly through the
silent house, and seemed, to Jael&rsquo;s scared ears, a
copy of the infernal cachinnation which was wont to
issue from the bewitched mill!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it, Jael,&rdquo; he said, as soon as he
could speak; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nervousness&mdash;it&rsquo;s the reaction from
suspense! Wait,&mdash;have you told...?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Swanhilda, sir? not yet,&mdash;I thought I&rsquo;d best
break it gradually&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell her! don&rsquo;t hint it to her!&rdquo; He spoke
in a harsh whisper, bending forwards towards her:
&ldquo;Because&mdash;because he might not come after all!&rdquo;
Then the mocking devil seized upon him again; and
though he folded his arms and held down his head,
the unholy laughter which he strove to suppress
shook his whole body and turned his white face dark.</p>

<p>The housekeeper was glad to escape from the
room; for she thought Gloam must have gone mad,
and knew not what insane violence he might commit.
Her first impulse was to run out and summon help,
but after her immediate panic had cooled down, she
thought better of such a proceeding. The explanation
of his behaviour which Gloam himself
had given seemed, upon reflection, reasonable enough.
The abrupt manner in which she had told the news
had thrown him for the moment off his balance. It
was, upon the whole, rather a good sign than a bad
one, for it showed him not so much deadened by
suffering as he had appeared to be. When he had
had time to rally, he would be his own gentle and
manageable self once more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she made preparations to receive
David on his return. The young man&rsquo;s conduct
towards Swanhilda had so angered his mother that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
she had more than acquiesced in the banishment
which Gloam&rsquo;s rage had forced upon him. Not
that she loved Swanhilda much; nor did the mere
immorality of her son&rsquo;s deed greatly afflict her. But
she had never ceased to have faith that, sooner or
later, news would come of the yellow-haired maiden&rsquo;s
relatives beyond the sea. It would come, perhaps,
in the form of a wealthy and open-hearted gentleman;
or of a lady, with diamonds sparkling on her
hands and bosom. They would say, &ldquo;We have learnt
that the little niece or cousin whom we had thought
lost, was saved, and is living here with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
Jael would reply; &ldquo;and she has been brought up
as true a lady as if she were in a queen&rsquo;s palace; for
we knew she had blue blood in her veins, and would
come by her own at last.&rdquo; Then Swanhilda would
appear, and captivate them with her beauty and
simplicity. But when they offered to take her away,
the girl would say, &ldquo;Not without David, for I love
him!&rdquo; Whereupon, no doubt, there would be objections
and remonstrances; but David&rsquo;s handsome
face and engaging manners would half disarm them;
and at the last Jael herself would arise, and sacrificing
the woman to the mother, would declare
openly, &ldquo;He too is of gentle blood; his father was
old Harold Gloam; he is the descendant of gentlemen,
and not unworthy of the girl who loves him.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
So would resistance finally be overcome, and all
concerned be enriched.</p>

<p>Such had been Jael&rsquo;s dream; and her resentment
at the revelation of David&rsquo;s crime had been mainly
aroused by the fact that it involved the frustration
of a chance of fortune her own espousal of which
had rendered especially dear to her. When the
scheme was first conceived, the young man had,
indeed, acquiesced in it, but as time went on, and
inquiries proved fruitless, he had abandoned the hope
of obtaining wealth and station through Swanhilda&rsquo;s
means. Yet the girl loved him, and was very
beautiful; much of their time was of necessity
passed in each other&rsquo;s society; and in the end the
sin was sinned. Doubtless he had regretted her
ruin; but to make her honourable amends had not
been compatible with the projects of his ambition:
and when Gloam&rsquo;s unexpectedly violent outbreak
had driven him forth upon the world, he had perhaps
deemed his banishment a not inconvenient pretext
for freeing himself from the encumbrances, such as
they were, which might otherwise have impeded
him. He left Swanhilda behind, to pass her dark
hour alone.</p>

<p>But, this being so, what was the occasion of his
sudden change of purpose? Was he penitent? or
had he found that honour and expediency could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
made compatible after all? The letter which he had
written to Jael did not explicitly answer this question;
but from hints which it contained, the housekeeper
had drawn favourable inferences; and she
looked forward to his coming with agreeable anxiety.
She had told Gloam the news, intending (should he
refuse a reconciliation) to acknowledge to him that
his father was David&rsquo;s likewise. But his strange
behaviour had frightened this purpose out of her
head; and when she recollected it again, it seemed
most advisable that the revelation should for the
present be postponed.</p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>About sunset Jael was surprised by the beginning
of a jarring and rumbling noise, the like of which
had not been heard in the gorge for a number of
weeks past. Half incredulous of the evidence of
her own ears, she paused to listen. Certainly there
was no mistake&mdash;the mill was going! She stepped
to the window and looked out. Yes, there revolved
the great black wheel heavily upon its axle, churning
the headlong torrent into foam, and hurling the
white froth from its rigid rims. As she gazed,
astonished, she saw Gloam issue from the mill and
stand beside the boiling mill-race, watching, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
manifest excitement, the sullen churning of the huge
machine. He wore no hat, his hair was tossed and
tangled, his bearing reckless and wild. All at once
(for the machinery, having been so long out of use,
had doubtless become very rusty) an unearthly peal
of laughter&mdash;or what seemed such&mdash;was launched
upon the evening air. It partly died away; then it
again burst forth, clinging to the listener&rsquo;s ears and
stabbing them, and leaving a sting that rankled
there long afterwards. In the midst of the infernal
din, Jael saw Gloam toss up his arms and abandon
himself to a sympathetic paroxysm of grisly merriment.
The man and the machinery were possessed
by one and the same demon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master&mdash;Master Gloam!&rdquo; cried the woman,
throwing open the window and lifting her voice to
her shrillest pitch, &ldquo;what is the matter? Why have
you set the mill going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced up at her with wild eyes, and waved
his hand. &ldquo;It is a season of rejoicing,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;The prayer that I prayed is coming to pass. Therefore
let the wheel go round. Hear it, how it laughs
and rejoices!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is no grist&mdash;the mill is empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will not be empty long; the grist is coming.
It comes! it comes! Let the great wheel go round
and grind it to powder!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Jael drew back with a sickening apprehension at
her heart. Gloam was too plainly in a state of
delirious frenzy, if he were not actually mad. She
longed for David&rsquo;s appearance, and yet dreaded it;
she knew not whether the meeting between the two
men would issue well or ill. And then her mind
reverted to Swanhilda, and she asked herself what
the effect of her lover&rsquo;s presence would be upon
her. Ever since the first week following upon his departure
the young mother had maintained a singularly
passive demeanour, only occasionally disturbed by
seasons of vague and tremulous anxiety. The housekeeper
had looked in upon her several times that
afternoon. She lay quietly in one position, her eyes
open and fixed, save when the baby claimed her
attention. She did not speak, and seemed scarcely
aware of outward things. Even the uproar of the
mill, when that began, commanded her notice but
for a short time, and appeared rather to gratify than
to distress her. She perhaps associated it with the
thought of David, and fancied it in some way
indicative of that home-return which she had all
along never allowed herself to despair of. But she
was as one partly entranced, whose ears and eyes,
as some believe, are opened to things beyond the
ordinary ken of human senses.</p>

<p>The evening was cloudy, and night came on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
apace. Gloam had re-entered the house shortly after
dark, and Jael presently went to his room to ask
him where he would take his evening meal. But he
met her in the upper passage-way. He seemed to
carry something in his hand. She could not make
out what it was, and he immediately hid it beneath
his coat. To her inquiries he replied that he was
going forth to resume his old practice of walking, and
that he would sup with David after his return. Jael,
in her uneasiness, would gladly have persuaded him
to remain at home; but he was obstinate against all
entreaties, and finally pushed roughly by her and
was gone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mill was still in motion. The
housekeeper had an impulse, soon after Gloam&rsquo;s
departure, to go out and uncouple the machinery;
but she feared lest he might resent her interference,
and forebore. The noise, and the suspense she was
in, combined to keep her in a state of feverish restlessness.
Her thoughts busied themselves, against
her will, with all manner of gloomy and painful
memories and speculations. The vision of her youth
rose up before her, and filled her with vain, remorseful
terrors. She strove to cheer herself with picturing
her son&rsquo;s arrival; but even that had now become a
source of apprehension rather than of comfort. All
the time she was oppressed by an indefinable sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that someone was prowling about outside the
house; and once, after the wheel had delivered itself
of an outpouring of inhuman mirth, Jael fancied the
strain was taken up in a no less wild, though not so
penetrating key. Was it possible that Gloam was
lurking in the gorge? And, if so, what could he be
doing there? Cautiously she peered out of the
window; but the moon was as yet obscured by
clouds, and nothing was certainly distinguishable.
She returned to the fireside; yet paused and listened
again, because&mdash;or else her excited imagination deceived
her&mdash;another and a different sound had reached
her from without: a sharp, grating sound, like that
made by a rusty saw eating its way through close-grained
timber. Ere she could be certain about the
matter, however, the noise stopped, and returned no
more.</p>

<p>An hour or so later, it wanting then only a few
minutes of midnight, Swanhilda suddenly awoke
from her half-trance, and sat upright in her bed. The
house resounded dully to the muffled throbbing of the
machinery, but otherwise there was no stir. The little
baby had fallen sound asleep, and lay at its mother&rsquo;s
side, with its tiny hands folded beneath its chin, and
grasping the pearl-shell necklace, which was its
favourite plaything. After sitting tense and still for
a moment, Swanhilda got out of bed, huddled on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
some clothes, kissed the unconscious baby twice or
thrice, and then silently left the room. In another
minute she had stolen down the stairs, and was
standing between the house and the stream in the
open air. She looked first one way and then another,
and finally, without any hesitation in her manner, but
with an assured and joyful bearing, bent her steps
towards the top of the gorge. A narrow footpath led
up thither, and at the highest point turned to the
right, and was carried across the torrent by a narrow
bridge formed of a single plank. When Swanhilda
came to the turn, she did not go over the bridge, but
sat down upon a stone amidst the shrubbery, and
waited.</p>

<p>How had she known that there was anyone to
wait for? Jael, certainly, had told her nothing; still
less could she have learned anything from Gloam.
Nevertheless, there she sat, waiting, and knowing
beyond question that her lover was near, and was
rapidly coming nearer. In a few minutes she would
hear his steps; then he would be upon the bridge,
and she would rise and meet him there. Had he not
promised, months ago, that he would never leave her?
and though he had been driven away for a time, she
had never doubted that he would return. He loved
her; soon, soon she would feel his arms about her,
his kisses on her lips. Ah! what happiness after all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
this pain; what measureless content! How glad
would be their meeting; and when she showed him
their little baby, the cup of joy would be full. Nay,
it was so already. In all Swanhilda&rsquo;s life she had
never known a moment so free from all earthly trouble
as was this!</p>

<p>It was near the end. She stood up; she had
heard a footstep; yes, there again! He must be
close at hand; if it were not so dark she would have
already seen him. And now the clouds which had so
long obscured the moon broke away, and the pale
sphere hung poised in dark purple space, and shed a
dim lustre over the little gorge. The light glanced on
the curve of the cataract, and twinkled in the eddies
of the pool, and danced along the tumultuous rapid,
and glistened upon the froth of the mill-race. There
the black wheel still plunged to its work, whirling its
gaunt arms about as if grasping for a victim. In the
bushes close beside it crouched a man with white face
and staring eyes. He had laid his trap, and was
waiting the issue. He had not seen Swanhilda leave
the house and climb the little path; his eyes and
thoughts had been turned elsewhither.</p>

<p>David came swiftly along the upland path,
whistling to himself as he walked. We will not
search his thoughts, seeing he was so near the end of
his journey. When he arrived at the brow of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
gorge, and was within a few paces of the bridge, he
halted and peered forward earnestly. What figure
was that that seemed to stand expectantly on the
other side? It could not be Swanhilda&mdash;ay, but it
was! He gave a little laugh, and then his hard heart
softened and warmed towards her. &ldquo;How she does
love me, poor little thing!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;ve treated her devilish badly, no mistake. Well,
well, I&rsquo;ll make it up to her, if all goes well, see if I
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came on to the bridge, and Swanhilda also
hurried forward. Then the man below among the
bushes started up, dry-mouthed and breathless. In
an instant he sent forth a great, terrible cry of warning
and agony; but before it could be uttered the lovers
had met upon the narrow plank, and Swanhilda had
received her kiss. While their lips yet touched, the
plank, sawn in two all but a finger&rsquo;s breadth, broke
downwards, and they fell, clasped in each other&rsquo;s
arms&mdash;headlong down over the fall, down to the
bottom of the eddying pool; up again, and over in
the rapids, whirling round and round, dashed against
the jagged stones, bleeding piteously; stunned, let
us trust, already, but still clinging to each other.
Now the last plunge: and so, at length, with a final
shriek of heaven-defying laughter, the hungry demon
of the wheel grappled its prey. Ay, snatch at them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
tear, break, grind them down and hold them there;
they are past feeling now. But not so the man upon
the bank, with uncovered hair showing black and
white in the moonlight, who has looked on at this
scene, powerless to help, but awake to every swift
phase of the tragedy, losing not a struggle or a pang,
realising his own unspeakable horror and anguish,
and foreseeing no comfort or pardon through all time
to come.</p>

<p>The wheel stopped suddenly. Jael came breathless
out of the mill-house, and shrinkingly approached
the margin. A formless mass of something was
wedged beneath the lower rim of the wheel and the
bed of the stream, and a long mass of yellow hair
floated out along the black water, and gleamed in the
lustre of the untroubled moon. The man on the
other side was kneeling down, and seemed to be
gazing idly into the current.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was your brother,&rdquo; said Jael, sobbing with
rage and misery. &ldquo;Your father was his. You have
murdered him. God curse you! I wish you lay
where he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jael,&rdquo; returned Gloam, smiling at her,
&ldquo;you invoke a curse and a blessing in the same
breath! My brother?&mdash;well. Swanhilda loved him
and not me. Thank God I was the brother of the
man she loved; the same blood ran in our veins&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
loved a part of me in him. But why do you
trouble yourself to curse me, Jael? I ask the charity
of all men, and their sympathy!&rdquo;...</p>

<p>I unclasped my hands from above my eyes, and
started to my feet. No, there was no one near me;
I was quite alone. It was deep twilight, but objects
were still discernible: yet nowhere, neither beneath
the Black Oak, nor beside the Laughing Wheel, nor
anywhere in the gorge, could I see a trace of my late
companion&mdash;of him whose last words were even then
ringing in my ears: &ldquo;I ask the charity of all men,
and their sympathy!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>The next morning I was down late to breakfast.
It was glorious weather, and the blue sparkle of the
sea came through the open window, bringing with it
a limitless inspiration of hope and wholesomeness.
It was difficult to believe that there had ever been
any sorrow or wrong in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re not looking right hearty,&rdquo; said Mr. Poyntz,
with bluff geniality, while his good wife set before me
a huge plate of daintily fried bacon and eggs, and a
smoking cup of coffee. &ldquo;Maybe ye walked a bit too
far last night? &rsquo;Twas powerful late afore ye got
home, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, glancing at Agatha, who was
knitting a pair of stockings for Peter in the eastern
window, the morning sun glistening on the broad
plaits of her yellow hair. &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Poyntz, I think
I must have made a very long journey last evening.
By-the-way, is not to-day Sunday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, surely!&rdquo; exclaimed husband and wife in a
breath; and then the former added, &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be wanting
to go to church, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not this Sunday; though I hope to go
before long, if Miss Agatha is willing to show me
the way.&rdquo; I glanced at her again as I said this, but
she would not look up, and I could not even be sure
whether she were listening. &ldquo;What I want,&rdquo; I continued,
&ldquo;is for you, Mr. Poyntz, since you&rsquo;ll be at
leisure, to take a stroll with me a little way up the
stream. It will be a novelty, perhaps almost as much
so to you as to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up the stream, is it?&rdquo; returned he, pausing in
the operation of cutting up a piece of tobacco, and
turning his blue eyes on me; &ldquo;why, truly, sir, that&rsquo;s a
trip I&rsquo;ve not made for a number of years. Howsoever,
none knows the road better than I do, and if
so be as naught else &rsquo;ll do ye, why, I&rsquo;m your
man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, so soon as I had done breakfast, the
sturdy old mariner mounted a wonderful glazed hat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and a new pea-jacket of blue pilot cloth, took a fresh
clay pipe from the mantelpiece, with a sigh and a
shake of the head over the destruction of his beloved
meerschaum, and professed himself ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Agatha,&rdquo; I said, passing the window.
&ldquo;Is there anything you would like me to bring you
when we come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a great many!&rdquo; answered she, looking up
gravely; &ldquo;but nothing, I&rsquo;m afraid, that you can get
for me. Though&mdash;you&rsquo;ll bring yourself back to
dinner, I suppose, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bent over her knitting as she said it, and
her mouth and downcast eyelids were very demure.
Nevertheless, I was encouraged to fancy that my
former remark about church-going had not fallen so
entirely unheeded as it had appeared to do. Before
I could hammer out a fitting answer (my brain always
seemed to work with really abnormal sluggishness
when I most wanted to do myself credit with
Agatha), Poyntz rolled out in his deep, jovial voice,
&ldquo;Back to Sunday dinner? Well, I should hope so.
Why, the old woman is baking a pie as I&rsquo;d sail round
the Horn to get a snack of! Come on, Mr. Firemount;
it&rsquo;ll go hard but we fetches back an appetite
as &rsquo;ll warm the women&rsquo;s hearts to look at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We trudged off at a tolerably round pace, and
soon struck into a narrow grass-grown lane which led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
towards the east; and had proceeded some distance
along it before I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Mr. Poyntz, that your daughter is
one of the loveliest women in the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye mean Agatha? Ay, surely, that she is,
heaven bless her! She was always that. A tiny bit
of a lass, I remember her, not so long as my arm; as
pretty a baby she was then as she&rsquo;s a woman now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she any thought of getting married soon?
Such a face and character must have suitors enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as touching that, sir,&rdquo; said Poyntz, taking
his pipe out of his mouth and looking at it carefully,
&ldquo;ye mustn&rsquo;t think of Agatha just the same
as of the fishermen&rsquo;s girls you meet round about.
Good, honest girls they all are, I&rsquo;m saying naught
against that; but Agatha, d&rsquo;ye see, is a bit different.
Ye&rsquo;ll maybe think it queer I should say
it, sir; but say it I will that Agatha is a lady.
She may live in our house, and put up with our
ways&mdash;nay, and love us too, which sure I am she
does; but all the same, if ye notice, she don&rsquo;t
speak the same as me and the old woman do,
nor she don&rsquo;t think the same neither. She&rsquo;s
built on other lines, as I may say&mdash;a clipper yacht,
while we&rsquo;re but fishing smacks, or trading schooners
at best. And that being so as it is, the young fellows
of our neighbourhood don&rsquo;t find they&rsquo;ve got much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
show alongside of her somehow. They&rsquo;re afraid of
her, that&rsquo;s the long and short of it. Not but she
treats &rsquo;em kind enough, ye understand, as a lady
should; but &rsquo;tis the kindness of a lady, and not of
an equal, and there&rsquo;s not one of &rsquo;em staunch enough
to hold out against it. And how be they&rsquo;re fine lads,
many of them, I can&rsquo;t truly say as I&rsquo;m sorry for it,
if so as Agatha is content.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor can I,&rdquo; I echoed to myself, with devout
earnestness. &ldquo;She does seem of a different stock
from most I see here,&rdquo; I said aloud. &ldquo;I have seen
women somewhat like her at Copenhagen; though I
don&rsquo;t know whether I should have thought of that
if I hadn&rsquo;t happened to say something in Danish,
yesterday, and she answered me in the same
language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she now!&rdquo; said Poyntz, tipping forward
his hat and scratching the back of his head. &ldquo;And
if I might ask it, sir, how came ye to speak Danish
your own self?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My family was Danish before I was born; and
I was taught the language almost before I knew
English. Our name used to be Feuerberg; but
we&rsquo;ve translated it since we&rsquo;ve emigrated, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, surely&mdash;Feuerberg,&rdquo; said Poyntz, puffing his
pipe preoccupiedly.</p>

<p>We walked on for awhile in silence. So great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was my desire that the evidence I had been arranging
in my mind should be borne out by the
facts, that I was almost afraid to put the matter
definitely to the proof; while Poyntz, on the other
hand, was evidently taken by surprise, and had not
got his ideas quite settled. At length, however, I
thought I would hazard one hint more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking of that yarn you were spinning
yesterday afternoon&mdash;in fact, I believe I dreamt
of it last night; and I should imagine that the little
yellow-haired girl, if she grew up, would have looked
enough like Agatha to be her sister&mdash;or her mother,
at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been thinking, sir, of the accident that
stopped me from finishing that there yarn ye speak
of, and of the hearty thanks I owe ye for the stout
heart and ready hand that saved my Peter. But
thanks is easily said; and I mean more than words
come to. I&rsquo;d not have ye suppose as I&rsquo;d give all
trust and confidence to a man just because he&rsquo;s done
a brave act for me and mine. But as I told you once
afore, and speaking out man to man, I like the looks
of ye, and ever did; and seeing as how ye&rsquo;ve found
out a good bit of our little secret already, and seem
like you&rsquo;d an interest to know more of it; for that,
and likewise because of another thing, as I&rsquo;ve just
found out myself, and it may be as important as any&mdash;well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ll tell ye what about Agatha there is to
tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment, however, we passed round a
clump of oak trees, and found ourselves right at the
entrance of the little gorge where I had had my
adventure the night before. Poyntz halted, and fixed
his eyes gravely upon the scene for several moments.
&ldquo;Ay, the same old harbour,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s changed a
bit now, but it brings it all back to me the last time
I was here. This is the Laughing Mill, Mr. Feuerberg.
And this here is the Black Oak, and here is poor
Gloam&rsquo;s grave, d&rsquo;ye see? with the bit of gray stone
a-sticking out of the end of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why was he buried here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;twas his wish; that&rsquo;s all. He was crazed
the last years of his life, with grieving on the death
of the young girl as he&rsquo;d picked up on the beach,
that I was telling you of. A sad thing it was altogether.
She went wrong, d&rsquo;ye see, with the fellow
David, the Scholar&rsquo;s brother, and was drowned here
along with him; but how that came to pass was
never rightly known. &rsquo;Tis thought the Scholar had
meant for to marry the girl himself. And so would
David have married her, I doubt, if he&rsquo;d known what
I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir, that. Ye maybe &rsquo;ll remember the iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
box as I picked up? Well, I didn&rsquo;t tell anyone
about it then, not even the Scholar; and soon after
the night of the storm I shipped for Rio, and was
away a matter of two years. When I came back
I heard as how David was thick with the girl&mdash;Swanhilda
they called her. Then I opened the box,
not having done it before, and found papers in it
telling who she was, and that folks of hers were
living in Germany, having emigrated there from
Denmark; and from what I could make out&mdash;for
&rsquo;twas in a foreign lingo, and I was forced to borrow
a lexicon to it&mdash;it seemed likely as how they was
well off. Now, I had my opinion of David, that
he was a worthless sort of a chap, though clever
and handsome; so thinks I, I won&rsquo;t tell him of this,
for if so be as I do, he&rsquo;ll wed the girl in the hope
of money, and not for true love of her, who was
worthy the love of better than he. But what I&rsquo;ll do,
I&rsquo;ll write to those her folks in Germany, telling them
as how she&rsquo;s here; and when they come, then they
can do for her as they find best, and it&rsquo;ll be out of
my hands. And so I did, but had never an answer,
why I don&rsquo;t know. But it never came in my mind,
sir, that the fellow David would ever be so black
a scoundrel as to lead the poor innocent girl wrong.
How be, when he had done it, thinks I, I&rsquo;ll tell him
of her folks now, because now the best can happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
will be that they marry, though the best is bad
enough; and if I tell him, maybe he&rsquo;ll make her an
honest woman, as the saying is. And tell him I did,
with a piece of my mind touching my thought of him,
into the bargain. And he promised me as he&rsquo;d go
and make it right the next day&mdash;this being spoke
in the town above here, whither I&rsquo;d gone for to see
him. And it can&rsquo;t be said but what he kept his
word; only he and she was drowned in the night,
and crushed under that there wheel, as never has
turned since, to this day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What became of her baby&mdash;she had a baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, and so she did, sir. Well, &rsquo;twas cared for
by the housekeeper&mdash;she being grandmother to it
and so having first right, the more as the Scholar was
crazed, though not dangerous, but mild and melancholy-like.
But in years the old woman she came to
the poor-house, and there died; and I took the baby,
and gave her what best I had to give, and better
schooling than the lasses care for hereabouts. And
as luck would have it, an elderly woman of Danish
blood being come by a chance to the village, I got
her to be nurse to the little one, and so grew up
to a knowledge of her native tongue, d&rsquo;ye see, and the
fairy tales and such like thereto belonging. And&mdash;ay,
I see you&rsquo;ve guessed it long already, sir&mdash;that&rsquo;s
Agatha.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>I had intended relating my vision to Mr. Poyntz
on the spot where it occurred; but I know not
what reluctance prevented me. It was too solemn
and inexplicable an experience to bear discussion
so soon. So, instead of that, I told him, as we
trudged homewards together, the history of the
Feuerberg family, and how all tended to ratify
my conviction that Agatha and I were cousins,
though far removed. And I may remark here that
he and I between us had afterwards no difficulty
(what with his documents and my knowledge) in
establishing the relationship beyond a doubt. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
I added, as we stood on the brow of the slope overlooking
the old house, and saw Agatha appear round
the corner and kiss her hand to us, &ldquo;but she and
I are the last of our race, and there is no great
fortune awaiting us, that I know of. Only, Mr. Poyntz,
I love her with my whole heart; if she can love me,
will you trust her to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, ye mustn&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; replied the ancient
mariner, grasping my hand, with tears in his old blue
eyes. &ldquo;I doubt she loves you well, already. And so
do we all, for ye&rsquo;re a man, all be a quiet one. &rsquo;Twill
be hard parting with her, as has been sunshine to us
this many a year; but ye&rsquo;ll bring her to see the old
folks, as time serves; and I&rsquo;m bold for to believe ye&rsquo;ll
be as happy as the day is long.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>It is twenty years since then, and old Jack
Poyntz&rsquo;s prophecy has proved true. My wife is wont
to say, with a smile in her dark eyes, that our
prosperity is due to the restored virtue of the pearl-shell
necklace, which still rests upon her bosom.
To me, however, the necklace seems but as the
symbol of the true love whose radiance has blessed
our lives, and brought us better luck than any witchcraft
can bestow.</p>

<h2>CALBOT&rsquo;S RIVAL.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> bitter cold weather out of doors made the cosy
glow of my little library even more than usually
grateful. I had carried the warm and bright anticipation
of it close-buttoned under my top-coat throughout
my cold drive in the hansom from the South-Western
Railway Station to my rooms on the
Thames Embankment. But now, as I stepped in and
shut the door behind me, I found I had done it less
than justice.</p>

<p>The four comfortable walls gave a broad smile
of welcome, which was multitudinously repeated from
the well-known back of every beloved book. Softly
gleamed the Argand burner from the green-topped
study table; hospitably flickered the blazing Wallsend
from the wide-mouthed grate; seductive was the invitation
extended me by padded easy-chair, fox-skin
hearthrug, and toasted slippers; crisp was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
greeting of the evening&rsquo;s  <cite>Pall Mall</cite> lying on the
table; and solid the promise of the latest  <cite>Contemporary</cite>,
containing, as I knew, my article on
&ldquo;Unrecognisable Truths in their Relation to Non-existent
Phenomena.&rdquo; Bethinking myself, moreover,
of the decanter of matchless old port-wine in the
right-hand cupboard of the table, and of the box
of prime Cabanas, made to my own order in Habana,
in the drawer on the left, I was not so much disposed
to envy Calbot his late betrothal to the
beautiful Miss Burleigh, the news whereof he had
triumphantly poured into my bachelor ears a week
or two before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Drayton, old fellow,&rdquo; I muttered
to myself, as I pushed off my boots and slid my feet
into the toasted slippers; &ldquo;what matter though love,
courtship, and marriage be not for thee? Thou
hast yet thy luxuries&rdquo;&mdash;here I sank slowly into my
easy-chair, &ldquo;thy creature comforts&rdquo;&mdash;here I got out
the wine and the cigars, &ldquo;and thy beloved offspring!&rdquo;&mdash;here
I glanced at &ldquo;Unrecognisable Truths,&rdquo; <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
printed on the cover of the  <cite>Contemporary</cite>.</p>

<p>While I am pouring out and tasting a mellow
glass of port, let me briefly recall what and whence
I am.</p>

<p>Snugness, comfort, and privacy are my <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">desiderata</i>.
My visible possessions must be few, intrinsically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
valuable, and so disposed as to lie within the scope
of two or three paces and an outstretched arm.
My being a bachelor (and at the age of forty, I think
I may add a confirmed one) enables me to indulge
these and other whims conveniently and without
embarrassment.</p>

<p>My forefathers kept large establishments and had
big families&mdash;and plenty of bother and discomfort
into the bargain. But when my turn came, I sold
out everything (except a few old heirlooms, and a
part of the library, and an ancestral portrait or two),
put the cash proceeds in the Funds, and myself,
with my literary tastes and Ã¦sthetic culture, into
the rooms which I now occupy. I might live in a
much more grandiose style if I pleased, but in my
opinion I am very well off as I am. I can find my
way to Freemasons&rsquo; Tavern on occasions; my essays
are a power in the philosophic and theologic worlds;
and I can count on a friend or two worth their
weight in gold, morally, mentally, and materially.
Poor Calbot, to be sure&mdash;but more of him anon.</p>

<p>That is old Dean Drayton&rsquo;s portrait, over the
mantelpiece&mdash;taken one hundred and fifty years ago:
an ancestor and namesake of mine. He wrote a
pamphlet on witchcraft, or something of that sort,
which made a stir in its day. I had thoughts of
entering the ministry myself a long while ago; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
think it was about the time of my engagement to
Miss Seraphine Angell&mdash;the Bishop of Maresnest&rsquo;s
daughter. But when she jil&mdash;&mdash; when the affair
was discontinued I had second thoughts, ending in
the resolve to let both women and the ministry
severely alone for the future. So the name of
Drayton dies with me.</p>

<p>There is, I fancy, at once a curious similarity and
dissimilarity between the Dean and his descendant.
For one thing, we are both of us singularly liable
to be made confidants of delicate subjects; with this
difference, however, that whereas the Dean is&mdash;or
was&mdash;an old busybody (I am quoting history, not
my private judgment), my natural tendency is not
only to mind my own business, but to tell other
people to mind theirs. It&rsquo;s no use, though&mdash;they
only babble the more; and were I to lose all my
fortune, I could, by turning black-mailer, ensure a
permanent income twice as large as the one I have
now.</p>

<p>Another thing. The Dean was an alchemist&mdash;so
tradition says; and his descendant has a marked
taste for scientific subjects, though not of the occult
kind. One of the family heirlooms, by-the-way, was
a monument of the Dean&rsquo;s alchemic skill; it was a
large sealed vase or phial, ornamented with cabalistic
figures and inscriptions, and affirmed to contain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
veritable Elixir VitÃ¦, manufactured after years of
labour by the old gentleman, and corked up and put
away for future use. It unfortunately happened,
however, that he was killed by an upset of his coach,
away from home; and the vase remained sealed ever
afterwards. I have often thought of taking a little
out and analysing it; for even should it turn out not
to be the water of life, I thought it might possibly
resolve itself into a bottle of excellent brandy. But
I delayed too long; and at last the mysterious phial
very unexpectedly analysed itself, and dissipated
itself at the same moment&mdash;but, again, let me not
anticipate.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>I finished my first glass of wine, poured out
another, and taking up the  <cite>Contemporary</cite> turned to the
masterly discussion of &ldquo;Unrecognisable Truths,&rdquo; <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
Before I had reached the close of the opening period,
however, I heard the postman&rsquo;s knock.</p>

<p>I ought to have mentioned that I had been down
to Richmond that afternoon&mdash;an unusual thing for me
to do at that time of year. But the fact was that a
distant connection of mine had died a short time
before, and his effects were announced to be sold at
auction. I had reason to believe that among these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
effects were some old relics of my family&mdash;documents
and so forth&mdash;which I was interested to recover;
indeed, but that some foolish quarrel or other had
parted my relative and me years ago, I might doubtless
have had them at any time for the asking. Of
the precise nature of the documents in question I
was not precisely informed; Armstrong&mdash;such was
my relative&rsquo;s name&mdash;had taken care not to enlighten
me on the subject. When I read the announcement
of his death in  <cite>The Times</cite> I had half expected that
he might have bequeathed me the old things; but it
turned out that he had made no will at all, having,
as it appeared, no very great property to dispose of.
He was a queer fellow, and came of a queer family;
half insane I always considered them; and I know
they were suspected of witchcraft as long ago as the
time of our old Dean. Nay, the Dean himself was
whispered to have been the least bit overshadowed at
that epoch, owing, I understand, to one fussy habit
he had of encouraging confidences. One of these
Armstrong witches had communicated some devilish
secret or other to the reverend gentleman, I suppose,
and thus brought ill-repute upon him. However, the
Dean was no fool, and got out of the scrape by
writing that pamphlet on witchcraft.</p>

<p>Well, I was about to say that when I heard of the
sale I resolved to run over to Richmond and see what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
I could pick up. I got there just in time to see the
last lot knocked down. It was shockingly stupid of
me to have mistaken the hour&mdash;such a cold day, too,
and I so unaccustomed to running about the country
at that time of year. But there was no help for it;
I had to return as wise as I started, and the poorer
by the loss of my temper and expectations. I was
beginning to get in a good humour again, however,
what with my fire, and my cigar, and my article on
&ldquo;Truths,&rdquo; <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and partly, no doubt, by reason of the
genial effect of that old port-wine; besides, I am by
no means of a sour disposition, naturally; when all
of a sudden came the postman&rsquo;s knock, making me
start so that the ash of my cigar fell on the open
page of the  <cite>Contemporary</cite> and scorched a hole in it.
Postmen have always been a horror to me; I have
never enjoyed receiving letters since the date of a
certain missive from&mdash;from someone who is now the
wife of another man; and on this particular evening
I was more than commonly averse to any such interruption.
I laid my book on my knees, leaned back
in my chair, and blew an irritated cloud of smoke
towards the painted countenance of my ecclesiastical
ancestor over the fireplace. It curled and twisted
about his respectable visage, until I could almost
have believed that he winked one eye and moved his
ancient lips as if to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The servant brought in a square packet done up
in brown wrapping-paper, and sealed in half-a-dozen
places. It was about the size and shape of the
magazine I had been reading&mdash;a little thicker,
perhaps, and heavier. I put my name to the receipt
accompanying the parcel, and the servant went out.</p>

<p>At first I was disposed to let the thing lie
unopened till the next day, being well assured that
it would not repay examination: and I actually did
put it aside and attempt to resume my reading as
though no interruption had occurred. But I found it
impossible to get on, or to fix my thoughts upon
anything except just that parcel. What could be in
it? Who could have sent it? I looked at the
direction, but could make nothing out of that; it
was written in an ordinary business hand, quite
characterless and non-committal. I felt it carefully
all over; it was stiffer than ordinary paper, but not
hard like wood. Meanwhile I glanced up at my
pictured ancestor, and was struck with the expression
of anxious interest which appeared to have come
over his features. Perhaps he knew what the packet
contained; or more probably his ruling passion of
curiosity, strong in death, was making his old painted
fingers itch to break the seals and take a peep at the
mystery. The idea provoked me, and with a sudden
impulse I held the packet out over the blazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Wallsend, two-thirds minded to drop it in. But the
next moment I was more provoked at my own
childish folly. I drew the thing back, took my penknife
from my pocket, and cut the strings that tied it.
Unwrapping the paper, there was disclosed to view a
very antique-looking leather case or cover&mdash;a pocketbook
or portfolio to all appearance. I undid the
worn strap that fastened it, and it fell open, showing
a number of leaves of musty parchment, written
over with a quaint and crabbed chirography, such as
could not have been in vogue for a good deal more
than a century, to say the least.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>I am something of an antiquary, and not entirely
without experience of <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> older even than this
appeared to be. Having convinced myself by a
cursory inspection that the matter was worth looking
into, I lost no time in composing myself to its
perusal.</p>

<p>It was written in Latin&mdash;a fortunate circumstance,
since there was none of the difficulty attendant upon
old-fashioned bad spelling to contend with. The
substance of the writing consisted, so far as I was
able to make out, of extracts from a number of
private letters, supplemented by passages from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
pages of a journal and by occasional observations
made apparently in the transcriber&rsquo;s own person.
The combination formed a tolerably consecutive and
logical history of three individuals&mdash;a woman and
two men&mdash;who lived and loved and hated with the
antiquated vehemence of a century and a half ago.</p>

<p>An odd circumstance which was immediately
noticeable in the compilation was a systematic
omission of the names of all the actors in the events
narrated. A blank space of some length was left
for each one, as though the writer had intended
filling them in afterwards, but, for whatever cause,
had failed to do so. Even the scribe himself&mdash;he
was a friend or confidential adviser, as it seemed, of
the principal figure in the narrative&mdash;had suffered
himself to remain as nameless as the rest.</p>

<p>This omission affected me strangely. So far from
alienating my interest, it greatly augmented it; and
although the body of the writing was couched in
terms sufficiently dry and matter-of-fact, the blank
spaces gave rein to the imagination, and lent the
story a present and almost a personal vitality and
significance. It almost seemed to me that the matter
was, in some way or other, my individual concern&mdash;that
I was, or had been, involved in the incidents
here set forth, and had still to look forward to the
catastrophe. The potent port, I fancy, must have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
little o&rsquo;ercrowed my spirit; but I believe I ascribed
it, at the same time, to the peculiar influence exerted
over me by the portrait of my reverend ancestor.
He seemed positively to be alive, and preparing to
come down from his frame and take the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> into
his own possession.</p>

<p>I spent a long time in trying to find out whence
the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> came, and why it had been sent to me.
But to this problem there was no apparent clue&mdash;no
tangible evidence, external or internal. Of course I
was sure that the secret lay in the blank spaces; and
was half inclined to cut the knot by filling them up
with my own name and with those of the first three
friends of mine that happened to come into my
head. However, after quite working myself into a
fever, and ruining the flavour of my Cabana by
letting it go out and then relighting it, I finally
contented myself by stopping the pregnant gaps
with the first four letters of the alphabet; and thus
furnished forth, I buckled earnestly and steadily to
my work, progressing so rapidly that in less than
three hours&rsquo; time I had mastered the whole narrative.</p>

<p>It was an unpleasant story, certainly, but there
was nothing particularly weird or remarkable, after
all, in the incidents related. From a literary point of
view, it was greatly lacking in point and completeness;
for though it ended with the death of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
chief character and the marriage of the other two,
yet the interest of the reader advanced beyond the
written limits, and demanded a more definite conclusion.
Things were left at such loose ends, in spite
of death and marriage, that it was hard not to believe
that more remained behind. In the heated and
excited condition of my imagination, I felt strongly
tempted to snatch up my pen and improvise an
ending on my own responsibility.</p>

<p>The longer I mused over the matter the more
convinced did I become that all had not been told.
Moreover, I could almost fancy that I had some
occult perception of what the true and ultimate
conclusion really was; nay, even that the authorship
of this very <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>, which had been penned considerably
more than a hundred years before I was
born, was nevertheless mystically my own. I repeat,
there seemed to be something of myself in it; and
the events had an inexplicable sort of familiarity to
my mind, as though they were long forgotten, rather
than now known for the first time. And all the
while that alchemic progenitor of mine kept up his
mysterious winking and nodding.</p>

<p>It would be too long and tedious to transcribe the
tale as I read it; I will therefore give, as briefly as
possible, an abstract of the leading points round
which it was woven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Shortly before the beginning of the last century, a
wealthy gentleman&mdash;let us call him A.&mdash;made a proposal
for the hand of a young lady living in the
neighbourhood of London, the daughter of an excellent
family, though at that time somewhat reduced in
circumstances, probably in consequence of political
jealousies. Judging from what is said of her, this
young lady&mdash;Miss B.&mdash;must have been a famous
beauty; and it would not therefore be surprising if
A. had met with some rivalry in his suit. To all
appearances, however, the course of true love flowed
as smooth as oil. The B. family, in spite of their
political disaffection, did not oppose the marriage of
their daughter to so wealthy and respectable a suitor;
and if she herself had any disinclination to him, she
very probably and prudently said nothing about it,
but treated Mr. A. very graciously.</p>

<p>A.&rsquo;s property, and the general management of his
business affairs, were entrusted by him to the care of
a talented young barrister, C. by name; who, indeed,
largely owed his prosperity and brilliant prospects to
A.&rsquo;s kindness, the latter having aided him in his preparation
for the Bar, and afterwards put a great deal
of business in his way, which otherwise he would have
obtained but slowly. In fact, A&rsquo;s attitude towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
this young man was almost parental; and no wonder
if he felt himself secure in trusting his most private
concerns to one who owed him so deep a debt of
gratitude.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it would doubtless have been wiser
in him, a man somewhat advanced in life, not to have
made C. the bearer and utterer of his loving messages
to the lady of his heart, quite so often or so unreservedly
as he appears to have done. C., who
was probably a well-favoured and fascinating fellow
enough, must have seen more of Miss B. than did
her lover; and in his capacity of the latter&rsquo;s recognised
confidant, he could easily have obtained access
to her at any moment. Perhaps the young beauty
was not averse to a little flirtation with the handsome
and clever barrister. Perhaps she encouraged him;
the evidence, such as it is, would seem to point that
way. Be that as it may, we must admit that C. was
exposed to pretty strong temptation. His virtue, be
he who he might, must have had a struggle for it;
and if we imagine him rather warm-blooded and
tolerably weak-principled, we may be justly anxious
as to virtue&rsquo;s victory.</p>

<p>Having made what allowances we will, there is
no denying that C. turned out a great scoundrel.
A. one morning took his carriage and went up to
London, and the coachman stopped at the door of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the Court jeweller. Out steps Mr. A., with his velvet
cloak, his silk stockings, his plumed hat, and his
peaked beard; and, with his long rapier dangling at
his side, and his lace ruffles half concealing his white
hands, he makes his stately entry into the bowing
tradesman&rsquo;s shop. There he spends a long time
examining, with all the whimsical particularity of an
elderly lover, the trays upon trays of rare, rich, and
costly nicknacks which are set before him. It seems
as though he would never be suited. The pompous
horses, standing outside, shake their rattling head-gear
and stamp their proud hoofs impatiently; the
obsequious jeweller racks his brain and exhausts his
eloquence unavailingly. Never was there so difficult
a customer. At length the man of jewels picks up a
quaint-looking little locket, and is just on the point
of putting it down again, as not even worth the
trouble of offering, when Mr. A. exclaims:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold, Mr. Jeweller, that is what we are looking
for. What is the price of that locket?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh sir,&rdquo; replies the shrewd man of business,
quickly recovering from his first surprise, &ldquo;I see you
need not be informed of what is truly valuable.
This little locket, which most persons would look
upon as commonplace, is in fact, in more senses
than one, the jewel of my stock. It is made, you
perceive, out of a simple brown tourmaline, exquisitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
cut in relief. The workmanship is really
matchless, and the tourmaline itself&mdash;as perhaps you
are aware&mdash;is believed to be endowed with certain
mystic properties&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Mr. Jeweller,&rdquo; interrupts the dark-visaged
customer, in a somewhat testy tone; &ldquo;I
know the nature and properties of the trinket quite
as well as you do. What I desired of you was to
name your price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tradesman hesitated for a moment, and then,
summoning all his audacity to his aid, mentioned a
sum which made his own heart beat and his eyes
water. But the composure of Mr. A. was not dashed
a whit. He even appeared to smile a little satirically,
as though to intimate that he considered himself as
having altogether the best of the bargain. He paid
the money without a moment&rsquo;s demur, and taking
up the locket before the excited jeweller had time
to put it in a box for him, Mr. A. saluted him
gravely and stalked out of the shop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought the tradesman, as he watched
the heavy coach roll away, &ldquo;if he&rsquo;s satisfied, I&rsquo;m
sure I ought to be. And yet&mdash;I wonder what that
locket was after all! I don&rsquo;t remember having ever
noticed it amongst the stock before to-day. It
really was finely enchased, and may have been
more valuable than I supposed. But pshaw! fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
guineas! Such a stroke of business was never heard
of before. If the locket had been a witch&rsquo;s amulet,
with power to drive men mad or raise the Devil, I
should still have made a good profit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. A. was speeding on his way to his
betrothed. The fact is, they were to be married on
the morrow, and the honest gentleman had bought
the locket as a pre-nuptial gift. Probably the horses,
fleet and well-conditioned as they were, were somewhat
put to it to keep pace with their owner&rsquo;s
eagerness to be at the end of his journey. In due
time, however, behold them reined snorting up at
the gateway of the B. mansion, and Mr. A., locket
in hand, preparing to alight.</p>

<p>But, alas! it is too evident that some disaster has
occurred. The servant who opens the door is pale
and scared; the household is in disorder. Twice
does the visitor demand news of the master and
mistress before he can elicit a reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Present them my compliments, if they are at
leisure,&rdquo; continues Mr. A., &ldquo;and ask whether I may
request the honour of an interview with their
daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord bless me, sir!&rdquo; falters the trembling servant,
&ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you heard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo; says A., turning pale; &ldquo;what is
the matter, fellow? Is the young lady ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ill, sir? Lord bless me, sir, she&mdash;she&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. A. recoiled, and seemed to gasp for breath
for a moment. His face, from pale, became suddenly
overspread with a deep crimson flush, and the veins
on his forehead swelled. At length he burst out in
a terrible voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone? Where? With whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at this point the appearance of the master
and mistress relieved the wretched footman from his
unenviable position. The miserable story was soon
told. The young lady to whom Mr. A. had entrusted
his heart and honour, to whom he was to have been
united the next day, whose wedding gift he even
then held in his hand, had eloped the night before
in the good old-fashioned manner, and was by this
time far beyond the reach of pursuit, could pursuit
have availed. The flight had been six hours old
before it was discovered by the young lady&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But with whom? with whom? Who was the
villain who dared to rob me?&rdquo; cried Mr. A., storming
up and down the hall in ungovernable fury. &ldquo;Who
was it, madam, I say? Stop your wretched whimpering
and speak!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Mr. A.,&rdquo; quavered the poor lady,
struggling with her sobs, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you think? Why,
it&rsquo;s that young Mr. C. of yours, of course. Who else
could it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>At this reply, which he seems not in the least
to have expected, Mr. A. became suddenly and
appallingly calm. During a short space he made
neither sound nor movement. At length he slowly
uplifted one clenched hand above his head, and shook
it there with a kind of sluggish deliberation. To the
frightened and hushed spectators it seemed as if
the air grew dark around him as he did it. Still
without uttering a word he now partly unclosed his
hand, and there was seen to proceed from it a dusky
glow or gleam, as of phosphorescence. Drawing
in a deep breath, he exhaled it slowly over this
phosphorescent appearance, as if desirous of inspiring
it with the very essence of his being. If the account
is to be believed, the glow became more lurid, and
the tall figure of Mr. A. more sombre, with the
action.</p>

<p>Whatever this odd ceremony might mean, it had
the good effect of restoring the betrayed suitor to his
wonted courteous and grave self-possession. In a
manner at once earnest and dignified he besought
Mr. and Mrs. B. to pardon and overlook his late
violent and passionate demeanour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have erred deeply,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;in permitting,
even for a short time, that evil spirit which is ever
at hand to ensnare the rash and unwary to gain
dominion over me. For, alas! what right have I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to be angry? Your daughter, methinks, has better
reason to upbraid me than I her. What charm could
such a one as she is find in a graybeard like myself?
Truly, I blame her not, and sorrow only that she did
not frankly make known to me her disfavour, rather
than thus violently and suddenly cast me off. And
as for the partner of her flight, how can I do otherwise
than pardon him? Have I not trusted him
and loved him as a son? Nay, nay, I have been
an old fool&mdash;an old fool; but I will not be an
unforgiving one. See,&rdquo; he went on, in the same quiet
and colourless tone in which he had spoken throughout,
&ldquo;here is a trifle which I had purposed presenting
to your daughter as a symbol of my affection. It
is a jewel, curiously carven as you see, and fabled
to exert a benign and wholesome influence over
the wearer. How that may be, I know not; but sure
am I that aught freighted, like this, with the deepest
prayers and most earnest hopes of him who had
thought (a foolish thought&mdash;I see it now!) to win the
highest place in her regard, will not be refused by
her when, acknowledging my error, I beg her to
accept it as the gift of elder friend to friend.
Permit me, madam&rdquo;&mdash;he laid the locket in Mrs. B.&rsquo;s
hand, she half shrinkingly receiving it; &ldquo;you will soon
hear from your daughter and her husband&rdquo;&mdash;this
word he pronounced with a certain grave emphasis&mdash;&ldquo;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
your reply, let me venture to hope, will tend
to a speedy reconciliation. Present her, in my name
and with my blessing, with this gem; bid her
transmit it as an heirloom to her descendants; and
believe that, so long as it retains its form and virtue,
my spirit will not forget this solemn hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of this long-winded and
not altogether unambiguous speech, good Mr. A.
bowed himself out, and rumbled away in his stately
coach. Shortly afterwards the abdication of James II.
was known throughout England. The B.&rsquo;s rose at
once from their position of political obscurity to an
honoured and powerful place under the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rÃ©gime</i>.
C., who now turned out to have been for a long time
a plotter for the successful cause, was not long afterwards
installed as a Court favourite, and his beautiful
wife became the idol of society. Poor Mr. A., on the
other hand, had a sour time of it. He had been bitterly
opposed to the Prince of Orange, and naturally found
his present predicament an embarrassing one. He
appears to have met with quite an Iliad of misfortunes
and reverses; and a few years after William&rsquo;s
accession he died.</p>

<p>The general opinion was that he had devoted his
latter days to religious exercises. Certain it is, that
he was on terms of intimacy with an eminent divine
of the day; indeed, a careful analysis of references<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
satisfied me that the compiler of the mysterious <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>
and this divine could be no other than one and the
same person. And the inference thence that he
had died in the odour of sanctity would have been
easy enough, save for one discordant and sinister
circumstance.</p>

<p>This was reserved for the very last paragraph of
the narrative, and shed a peculiar and ill-omened
light over all that had gone before. It was related in
the transcriber&rsquo;s own person; and after describing
with some minuteness the last hours of Mr. A., it
concluded as follows. I translate from the original
Latin:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. A. having long lain without motion, breathing
hoarsely, and with his eyes half open, and of a rigid
and glazed appearance, as of a man already dead&mdash;all
at once raised himself up in bed, with a strength
and deliberation altogether unexpected; and having
once or twice passed his hand over his brow, and
coughed slightly in his throat, he said to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take your pen, friend, and write. I will now
dictate my last will and testament.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appeared to me that he must be delirious
both because he had, several hours previous, caused
his will to be brought to him and read in his ear
(this will bore date before the date of his intended
marriage with Miss B.), and also because his aspect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
notwithstanding the strength of his movements and
voice, was more that of a corpse than of a living
man; and he might have been believed, by those
who put faith in such superstitions, to be animated
by some unhallowed spirit not his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when I showed him that former will, supposing
him to have forgotten it, he bade me put it
in the fire; and when this had been done, and the
will consumed, he bade me write thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I, &mdash;&mdash; A., being nowe about to die, yet
knowynge well the nature of this my act, doe herebye
bequeathe my ondyinge Hatred to C. and to
his wife (formerly Miss B.), to them and to their
Posteritie. And I doe herebye pray Almighty God
that the Revenge which my Soule hath desired and
conceived, be fulfilled to the uttermoste, whether
soon or hereafter: yea, at the perill of my Salvation.
Amen!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Satanic composition was duly signed, sealed,
and witnessed as A.&rsquo;s last will and testament; and
the latest earthly act of the wretched man was the
affixing his signature to an instrument which, whatever
other end it might accomplish, could hardly
fail of exercising its deadliest venom against
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>I lit a fresh cigar, poured out another glass of
wine, and gave myself up to meditation. Those
blank spaces completely mystified me. For what
other object had this lengthy transcription been
made than to record A.&rsquo;s &ldquo;last will,&rdquo; and the causes
leading up to and (so far as that was possible) justifying
it? Yet, on the other hand, the careful omission
of every clue whereby the persons concerned might
have been identified seemed to annul and stultify the
laborious record of their actions. Or if the composition
were a mere fiction, why not have invented
names as well as incidents?</p>

<p>But fiction, I was satisfied, it could not be. It
was not the fashion to compose such fictions a
hundred and fifty or more years ago. And it was
not within the scope of such an arid old specimen of
the antique clergy as he whose stilted Latin and
angular chirography I had just examined to follow
such a fashion even had it existed. No, no. Account
for it how I might, the things here set down were
facts, not fancies.</p>

<p>The will was the only part of the compilation
written in English, as though it were especially commended
to the knowledge of all men; and it was
certainly not the sort of thing a dying man would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
apt to compose and have attested purely for his own
amusement. Yet, as it stood, it was no more than a
lifeless formula. But, indeed, so far as this feature of
the narrative was concerned, the subtlest casuistry
failed to enlighten me as to what Mr. A.&rsquo;s proposed
revenge had been, and how he expected it to be
accomplished. An attempt to make the tourmaline
locket serve as a key to the enigma promised well at
first, but could not quite be induced to fit the lock
after all. Either the problem was too abstruse, or
my head was not in the best condition for solving it.
The longer I puzzled over it, the more plainly did my
inefficiency appear; and at last I came to the very
sensible determination to go to bed, and hope for
clearer faculties on the morrow.</p>

<p>I had just finished winding up my watch, which
marked half-past ten, when there was a violent ring
at my door-bell, followed by a rattling appeal to the
knocker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A telegram!&rdquo; I exclaimed, falling back in my
chair. &ldquo;The only thing I detest more than a postman.
Well, the postman brought an enigma; perhaps
the telegram may contain the solution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not a telegram, but Calbot, to whom I have
already made incidental allusion. He opened the
library door without knocking, came swiftly in, and
walked up to the fire. This abruptness of manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
which was by no means proper to him, added to
something very peculiar in his general aspect and
expression, gave me quite a start.</p>

<p>He was dressed in light in-door costume, and, in
spite of the cold, wore neither top-coat nor gloves.
His face had a pallor which would have been extraordinary
in anyone, but in a man whose cheek was
ordinarily so ruddy and robust as Calbot&rsquo;s, it was
almost ghastly. He said nothing for some moments,
but seemed to be struggling with an irrepressible and
exaggerated physical tremor, resembling <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Vitus&rsquo;s
dance. I must say that my nerves have never been
more severely tried than by this unexpected apparition,
in so strange a guise, of a friend whom I had
always looked upon as about the most imperturbable
and common-sensible one I had. He was a young
man, but older than his years, clear-headed, practical,
clever, an excellent lawyer, and a fine fellow. Eccentricity
of any kind was altogether foreign to his character.
Something very unpleasant, I apprehended,
must be at the bottom of his present profound and
uncontrollable agitation.</p>

<p>Of course I jumped up after the first shock, and
shook his hand&mdash;which, notwithstanding the cold
weather and his own paleness, was dry and hot. I
fancied Calbot hardly knew where he was or what he
was doing; not that he seemed delirious, but rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
overwhelmingly preoccupied about something altogether
hateful and ugly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, John?&rdquo; I said, instinctively
using a sharp tone, and laying my hand heavily on
his shoulder. &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo; Then a thought struck
me, and I added: &ldquo;Nothing wrong about Miss
Burleigh, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drayton,&rdquo; said my friend&mdash;his utterance was
interrupted somewhat by the nervous starts and
twitches which still mastered his efforts to control
them&mdash;&ldquo;something terrible has happened. I wanted
to tell you. I can&rsquo;t fathom it. Drayton, I&rsquo;ve seen&mdash;&mdash;
May I take a glass of wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drank two glasses in quick succession. As
he hardly ever touched wine, there was no little
significance in the act. The rich old liquor evidently
did him good. To tell the truth, I would rather have
given him some brandy. He was not in a state to
appreciate a fine flavour, and my port was as rare
as it was good. However, I was really concerned
about him, and would gladly have given the whole
decanterful to set him right again.</p>

<p>He would not take a chair, but stood on the rug
with his back to the fire. As I sat looking up at his
tall figure, I caught the painted eye of my priestly
ancestor over his shoulder, and it seemed to me to
twinkle with saturnine humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you seen, Calbot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some evil thing has come between Miss Burleigh
and me, and has parted us. I have seen it&mdash;two or
three times. She has felt it. It&rsquo;s killing her, Drayton.
As for me.... You know me pretty well, and you
know what my life has been thus far. I&rsquo;ve not been
a good man, of course&mdash;quite the contrary; I&rsquo;ve done
any quantity of bad things, but I don&rsquo;t know that
I&rsquo;ve committed any such hideous sin as ought to
bring a punishment like this upon me&mdash;not to speak
of <em>her</em>! I&rsquo;m not a parricide, nor an adulterer; I
never sold my salvation to the devil&mdash;did I, Drayton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, of course not, my dear Calbot. You
have a fever, that&rsquo;s all. Don&rsquo;t get excited. Just lie
down on the sofa for half an hour, and quiet yourself
a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you think I&rsquo;m out of my head, and no
wonder. I behave like a madman. But I&rsquo;m not mad
at all; I wish I could think I were. This shuddering&mdash;it
won&rsquo;t last&mdash;but I tell you, Drayton, when you
see a man of my health and strength stricken this
way in two days, you may believe it would have driven
many a man to madness, or to suicide&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me pour it out for you; your hand shakes
so. I can give you some splendid French cognac,
if you&rsquo;d prefer it? Well. Hadn&rsquo;t you better lie
down?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, I can control myself, now&mdash;I will!&rdquo; said
Calbot, through his teeth, and putting a strong constraint
upon himself. For about a minute he kept
silent, the blood gradually coming into his cheeks and
the nervous twitchings growing less frequent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said I, encouragingly. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t look so much as though you&rsquo;d seen a ghost,
now. How is that Chancery case of yours getting
on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ghost? You speak lightly enough, and I
suppose your idea of a ghost is some conventional
bogey such as children are scared with. We laugh at
such things&mdash;heaven knows why! An evil, sin-breathing
spirit, coming from hell to take vengeance,
for some dead and buried wrong, upon living men
and women&mdash;what is there laughable in that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Calbot,&rdquo; I said, with a smile&mdash;a rather
uneasy smile, be it admitted&mdash;&ldquo;I never laughed at a
ghost, for the simple reason that I never saw one to
laugh at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never saw one, and you mean to hint, I
suppose, that there are none to see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned I, still maintaining a precarious
grimace, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a spiritualist, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; interrupted Calbot, in a lower and
quieter tone than he had yet used. He took a chair,
and, sitting down close in front of me, bent forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and whispered in my ear: &ldquo;But I saw the soul of a
dead man yesterday; and this afternoon I saw it
again, and chased it from the Burleighs&rsquo; house in
Mayfair, along the Strand, and through the heart of
London, to its grave in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> G&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s churchyard. I
copied the inscription on the stone: it is a very old
one, as you will see by the date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A far bolder man than I have ever claimed to be
might have felt his heart stand still at this speech;
and its effect on me was greatly heightened by
Calbot&rsquo;s tone and manner, and by the way he
fastened his eyes upon me. Nor were the circumstances
in other respects reassuring&mdash;alone at night,
with a man three or four times my physical equal,
who was wholly emancipated from rational control.
I sat quite still for a few moments&mdash;very long
moments they seemed to me&mdash;staring helplessly at
Calbot, who took a small notebook out of his pocket,
tore out a leaf with something scrawled on it, and
handed it to me. I read it mechanically&mdash;&ldquo;Archibald
Armstrong. Died February 6th, 1698.&rdquo; Meanwhile
Calbot helped himself to another glass of wine; but
I was too much unnerved to restrain him, and, indeed,
too much bewildered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Archibald Armstrong,&rdquo; muttered I, repeating
the name aloud; &ldquo;died February 6th&mdash;yes; but it
was this present year 1875&mdash;not 1698. Why, I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to the auction-sale of his effects this very afternoon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep the paper,&rdquo; said Calbot, not noticing my
observation, &ldquo;it may possibly lead to something.
And now I wish you to listen to my statement. I
am neither crazy, Drayton, nor intoxicated. But I
am not the same man you have known heretofore;
my life has been seared&mdash;blasted. Perhaps you think
my language extravagant; but after what I have
experienced there can be no such thing as extravagance
for me. It is an awful thing,&rdquo; he added, with a
long involuntary sigh, &ldquo;to have been face to face
with an evil spirit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, Calbot,&rdquo; cried I, starting up
from my chair, and trembling all over, I believe, from
nervous excitement, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go on talking and looking
like that. If you can tell me a straightforward, consistent
story, I&rsquo;ll listen to it; but these hints and
interjections of yours will drive me mad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you, Drayton, though it will be
the next worst thing to meeting that&mdash;&mdash;Thing&mdash;&mdash;itself,
to tell about it. But the matter is too grim
earnest to allow of trifling. You have a great deal of
knowledge on queer and out-of-the-way subjects,
Drayton, and I thought it not impossible that you
might make some suggestions, for there must be some
reason for this hideous visitation&mdash;some cause for it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and though all is over for me now, there would be a
kind of satisfaction in knowing what that reason was.
Besides, I must speak to someone, and you are a
dear friend, and an old one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was a good deal relieved to hear Calbot speak
thus affectionately of our relations with each other;
and indeed he appeared no way inclined to violence.
Accordingly, having offered him a Cabana (which he
refused), I put the box and the decanter back in the
cupboard, and locked the door. Then, relighting my
own cigar, and putting a lump or two of coal on the
fire, I resumed my chair, and bade my friend begin
his story.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;There was an intermarriage between the Burleighs
and the Calbots four or five generations ago,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;I found the record of it in our family papers, shortly
before Miss Burleigh and I were engaged; but it
appears not to have turned out well. I don&rsquo;t know
whether the husband and wife quarrelled, or whether
their troubles came from some outside interference;
but they had not been long married before a separation
took place&mdash;not a regular divorce, but the wife
went quietly back to her fathers house, and my
ancestor is supposed to have gone abroad. But this
was not the end of it, Drayton; for, some years later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the husband returned, and he and his wife lived
together again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there any further estrangement between
them, afterwards?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an ugly story,&rdquo; said Calbot, gloomily,
getting up from his chair, and taking his old place
before the fire. &ldquo;No; they lived together&mdash;as long
as they did live! But it was about the era of the
witchcraft mania&mdash;or delusion, if you choose to call it
so&mdash;and it is strongly hinted in some of the documents
in my possession that the Calbots were&mdash;not
witches&mdash;but victims of witchcraft. They accused no
one, but they seemed to have been shunned by everybody
like persons under the shadow of a curse.
Well&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t a great while before Mrs. Calbot died,
and her husband went mad soon afterwards. There
were two children. One of them, the son, was born
before the first separation. The other, a daughter, came
into the world after the reunion, and she was an idiot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ugly story, sure enough,&rdquo; said I, shrugging
my shoulders with a chilly sensation; &ldquo;but what has
it to do with your business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps nothing; but there is one thing which
would go for nothing in the way of legal evidence,
but which has impressed me, nevertheless. The
date of the second coming-together of my ancestor
and his wife was 1698.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you look at that paper I gave you you&rsquo;ll see
the date of Armstrong&rsquo;s death is also 1698.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still I don&rsquo;t see the point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply this: the&mdash;Thing I saw was the condemned
soul of that Archibald Armstrong. Who he
may have been I don&rsquo;t know; but I can&rsquo;t help
believing that my ancestor knew him when he was
still in the flesh. They had a feud, perhaps&mdash;maybe
about this very marriage&mdash;of course you understand
I&rsquo;m only supposing a case. Well, Calbot gets the
better of his rival, and is married. Then Armstrong
exerts his malignant ingenuity to set them at odds
with each other. He may have played on the
superstitious fancies which they probably shared
with others of that age, and at last we may suppose
he accomplished their separation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ingenious idea,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;but what about
your date?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, on hearing of his death, they would
naturally suppose all danger over, and that they
might live together unmolested. And from this
point you may differ with me or not, as you choose.
I believe that it was only after Armstrong was dead
that his power for evil became commensurate with
his will. I believe, Drayton,&rdquo; said Calbot, drawing
himself up to his full height, and emphasising his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
words with the slow gesture of his right arm, &ldquo;that
the soul of that dead man haunted that wretched
couple from the day of his death until the whole
tragedy was consummated&mdash;until the woman died
and the man went mad. And I believe that his
devilish malignity has lived on to this day, and
wreaked itself, a second time, on Miss Burleigh and
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a short pause, during which my poor
friend stood tapping one foot on the hearth-rug, his
eyes bent downwards in sombre abstraction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, my dear John,&rdquo; I said at length,
speaking with an effort, for there was a sensation of
heavy oppression on my chest; &ldquo;listen to me, old
fellow. You&rsquo;ve had time to cool down and bethink
yourself: so far as I can judge you appear, as you
say, neither crazy nor intoxicated. Now I wish you,
remembering that we are sensible, enlightened men,
living in London in this year 1875, to tell me honestly
whether I am to understand you as deliberately
asserting a belief in visitations from the other world.
Because, really, you know, that is what anyone
would infer from the way you have been talking this
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see there would be little use, Drayton, in my
answering your question directly; but I will give
you a deliberate and honest account of my personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
experiences during these last two days: there will
be no danger of your mistaking my meaning then.
You won&rsquo;t mind my walking up and down the
room while I&rsquo;m speaking, will you? The subject is
a painful one, and motion seems to make it easier,
somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did mind it very much, it made me as nervous
as a water-beetle; but, of course, I forbore to say
so, and Calbot went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I found out all this ancestral trouble
some time before I was engaged; and, as you may
imagine, I kept silence about it to Miss Burleigh.
I think now it was a mistake to do so; but my
ideas on many subjects have undergone modification
of late. I believe I had forgotten all about the
discovery by the time I had made up my mind to
risk an avowal: at any rate, I had no misgivings
about it; and when I came out from my interview
with her&mdash;the happiest man in England!&mdash;ah
Drayton, it seemed to me then that there could be
no more pains nor shadows in life for me thence-forward
for ever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I devoutly wished, not for the first time that
evening, that Calbot would not be so painfully in
earnest. In his normal state it was difficult to
get a serious word out of him; he was brimming
over with quaint humour and fun; but, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
himself had remarked, he was another man to-day.
After walking backwards and forwards once or
twice in silence, he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how happy I was those first few
days. I daresay you wished me and my happiness
in Jericho, when I insisted on deluging you with
an account of it. Think! Drayton, that was hardly
a week ago. Well, as soon as I had got a little
bit used to the feeling of being engaged, I began
to think what I should give her&mdash;Edna, you know&mdash;for
a betrothal gift. A ring, of course, is the usual
thing; but I couldn&rsquo;t be satisfied with a ring: I
wanted my gift to be something rare&mdash;unique; in
short, something different from what any other
fellow could give his mistress; for I loved her
more than any woman was ever loved before.
After a good deal of fruitless bother, I suddenly
bethought myself of a jewel-box which had belonged
to my mother&mdash;God bless her!&mdash;and which she had
bequeathed to me, intending, very likely, that I
should use it for the very purpose I was now thinking
of. I got out the box, and overhauled it. There
was a lot of curious old trinkets in it; but the
thing which at once took my eye was a delicately
wrought gold necklace, that looked as though it
had been made expressly for Edna&rsquo;s throat. There
was a locket attached to it, which I at first meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to take off; but on examining it closely, I found
it was quite worthy of the chain&mdash;was an exquisite
work of art, indeed. It was made of a dark yellow
or brownish sort of stone, semi-transparent, and
was engraven with a very finely-wrought bas-relief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calbot!&rdquo; exclaimed I, starting upright in my
chair, &ldquo;what sort of a stone did you say that locket
was made of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; returned he, stopping
short in his walk and facing me with a glance
partly apprehensive, partly expectant. &ldquo;I never
saw exactly such a stone before&mdash;but why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; said I, after a moment&rsquo;s excited
thought; &ldquo;it certainly is very strange! But, never
mind, go on,&rdquo; I added, throwing a glance at the
old manuscript which lay open on the table; &ldquo;go
on. I&rsquo;ll tell you afterwards; I must turn it over
in my mind a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reason I described it so minutely,&rdquo; remarked
Calbot, &ldquo;was that I got a notion into my head
that it had something to do with what happened
afterwards, and the reason of that notion is, that
almost from the very moment that Edna took the
necklace&mdash;I clasped it round her neck myself&mdash;the
strange awful influence&mdash;visitation&mdash;call it
what you like&mdash;began to be apparent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Drayton, you can never know how lovely,
how divine she looked that evening. She had on
what they call, I believe, a demi-toilette; open at
the throat, you know, and half the arm showing.
No woman could have looked more beautiful than
she, before I put on the chain and locket; yet
when they were on, she looked as handsome again.
It was really wonderful&mdash;the effect they had. Her
eyes deepened, and an indescribable change or
modulation&mdash;imperceptible, very likely, to anyone
beside myself, her lover&mdash;came over her face. I
think it was a shade of sadness&mdash;of mystery&mdash;no,
I can only repeat, that it was indescribable; but it
gave her beauty just the touch that made it, humanly
speaking, perfect. I daresay this is all very tiresome
to you, Drayton, but I can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said I warmly;
for, indeed, I was moved as well as excited. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you sit down? Here, take my chair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he would not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I fastened the clasp, I said: &lsquo;You are fettered
for ever now, Edna!&rsquo; and she said, with her eyes
sparkling: &lsquo;Yes, I am the thrall of the locket; the
giver may lead me in triumph where he will!&rsquo; Just
as the words passed her lips, Drayton, I felt a sensation
of coldness and depression; I gave an involuntary
shudder, and looking quickly in Edna&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
eyes, I saw there the very reflection of my own
feeling! We were alone, and yet there seemed to be
a third person present&mdash;cold, hateful, malevolent. He
seemed to be between us&mdash;to be pressing us irresistibly
apart; and I felt powerless to contend against
the insidious influence; and so was she. For an instant
or two we gazed fearfully and strangely at each
other; then she said faintly: &lsquo;Come to me&mdash;take me!&rsquo;
and half held out her arms, her face and lips all pale.
Drayton, I cannot tell you what a desperate struggle
I had with myself then! My whole soul leapt out
towards her with a passion such as I had never known
before; and yet my body seemed paralysed. I had
felt something similar to it in dreams before then;
but the dream pain was nothing to the real pain. A
cold dead hand was on my heart, dragging it backward,
deadening it; and another at my throat, stifling
me. But I fought against it&mdash;it seemed to me I
sweated drops of blood&mdash;but I overcame. I put my
arm round her waist&mdash;I kissed her; and yet, though I
seemed to hold her&mdash;though our lips seemed to meet&mdash;still
that Thing was between us&mdash;we did not really
touch each other! With all our love, we were like
lifeless clay to one another&rsquo;s caress. It was a mockery&mdash;our
souls could meet no more.&rdquo; Here Calbot
covered his eyes with his hand for a short time.
&ldquo;It was the last time I ever kissed her,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>I said nothing; my sympathy with my hapless
friend was keen. Yet I must confess to a secret sensation
of relief that there was to be no more kissing.
It was natural, under the circumstances, that Calbot&mdash;poor
fellow!&mdash;should speak recklessly; but I am a
bachelor, a confirmed bachelor, and such descriptions
distress me; they make me restless, wakeful, and
unhappy. Yes, I was glad we had had the last of
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It all passed very quickly, and a third person
would perhaps have seen no change in us; probably
the change was more inward than outward, after all.
It was peculiar that we, both of us, by a tacit understanding,
forbore to speak to each other of this dismal
mystery that had so suddenly grown up between us.
It was too real, and at the same time too hopeless; but
to have acknowledged it would have been to pronounce
it hopeless indeed. We would not do that yet. We
sat apart, quietly and conventionally making observations
on ordinary topics, as though we had been
newly introduced. And yet my betrothal gift was
round her neck, moving as she breathed; and we
loved each other, and our hearts were breaking. Oh,
it is cruel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In exclaiming thus, my friend (being at the farther
end of the room at the time) struck his foot sharp
against the leg of a small antique table which stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
against the wall. Like many other valuable things,
the table was fragile, and the leg broke. The table
tipped over, and a vase (the ancestral vase, containing
the elixir of life), fell off to the floor.</p>

<p>Calbot&mdash;I think it was much to his credit&mdash;found
room amidst his proper anguish to be sincerely distressed
at this accident. On picking up the vase,
however, he immediately exclaimed that it was
unbroken. This was fortunate: the table could be
mended, but the vase, not to speak of its contents,
would have been irreplaceable. Calbot put it carefully
on the study table, beside the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>; set the
invalid table in a corner; and then, to my great satisfaction,
drew up a chair to the fire, and continued his
sad story in a civilised posture.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I did not stay long after this; and ours was a
strange parting that evening, if our hearts could have
been seen. We felt it a relief to separate, and yet
the very relief was a finer kind of pain. We knew
not what had befallen us; but, perhaps, we both had
a hope, then, that another day would somehow set
things right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only took her hand in saying good-bye; but
again it seemed as if her soft fingers were not actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
in contact with mine&mdash;as if some rival hand were
interposed. And I noticed (as I had done once or
twice before during our latter conversation) that, even
while the farewell words were being spoken, she
turned her head abruptly with a startled, listening
expression, as though another voice had spoken close
at her ear. I could hear nothing, nor understand the
dimly terrified look in her eyes&mdash;a look appealing
and yet shrinking. But afterwards I understood it
all. When I reached the street, I turned back and
caught a glimpse of Edna at the window. Beside
her I fancied I distinguished the half-defined outlines
of a strange figure&mdash;that of a man who appeared to
be gesticulating in an extravagant manner. But
before I could decide whether it were a shadow or a
reality, Edna had turned away, and the apparition
vanished with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her father, of course,&rdquo; I threw in, with a glance
over my shoulder; &ldquo;or perhaps it was the footman.&rdquo;
Calbot made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got up yesterday morning,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;convinced
that the whole thing was a delusion. I took
a brisk walk round Hyde Park, ate a good breakfast,
and by eleven o&rsquo;clock was on my way to her house,
sure that I should find her as cheerfully disposed to
laugh at our dolorous behaviour the night before as
I myself was. I went down Piccadilly in the best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
spirits; but on turning the corner of Park Lane, I
very plainly saw three persons coming down towards
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Calbot paused so long that I could hardly
refrain from springing out of my chair. I had never
heard him argue a case before a jury; but had I been
the presiding judge himself, I was convinced that
Calbot could have moulded my opinions to whatsoever
issue he had pleased. But, on the other hand,
I doubt whether he was aware of his own best powers.
The effect he was now producing on me was certainly
not the result of any premeditated artifice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw Edna,&rdquo; he finally went on, speaking in a
husky labouring tone, and gazing intently over my
shoulder, as if he saw her <em>there</em>. &ldquo;She was walking
in the centre, with a weary lifeless step, her head
bent downwards: on her right was her father, as
jolly and portly as ever; and on her left, Drayton,
was the same strange figure of which I fancied I had
caught a glimpse the night before. It was no shadow
now, however, but looked as real and palpable as
General Burleigh himself. It appeared to be diligently
addressing itself to Edna, occasionally even
stooping to speak in her ear; and once I saw it put
its arm round her waist, and apparently press its
bearded cheek to her own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, Calbot, didn&rsquo;t you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
But there was something in my friend&rsquo;s eyes, as he
turned them on me, which made me break off just
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I first turned the corner the three were
sixty or seventy yards distant. It struck me at once
that Edna seemed to have no direct consciousness
of the stranger&rsquo;s presence. That is, she did not act as
if he were visible to her; though, at the same time,
I could hardly doubt that the <em>idea</em> of him was
present to her mind; and from her manner of involuntary
shrinking and starting when the Thing
became particularly demonstrative in its manner, I
fancied that the words which it appeared to address
to her insinuated themselves into her brain under
the form of dismal and hateful thoughts. Perhaps,
Drayton, the base or wicked notions that sometimes
creep into our minds unawares, asserting themselves
our own, are whispered to us by some evil spirit,
invisible to our sight, but capable of impressing the
immaterial part of us all the more effectively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As they drew near, I could no longer doubt that
the Thing was viewless, not only to Edna, but to
everyone else besides myself alone. Had it been
otherwise, the figure&rsquo;s remarkable costume, no less
than its many eccentricities, would have drawn a
great crowd in a few moments. It was a tall
fantastic apparition, clad in a black velvet cloak and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
doublet, silk hose, and high-heeled shoes. On its
head was a broad-brimmed hat, with heavy plumes;
there were lace ruffles at its wrists and round its
throat. A long rapier dangled by its side; its beard
was gray and peaked, but a copious powdered wig
flowed out beneath the hat and rested on the shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its gait, as it stalked along the pavement, was
mincing and affected, and under other circumstances
I might have laughed at it. Its manner and gestures
were absurdly exaggerated and fantastic. It was
continually bowing and scraping to Edna, and seemingly
making hot love to her; but as often as she
winced or shrank from it, it appeared hugely delighted,
throwing up its arms, wagging its head, and
contorting its body, as if carried away by an
immoderate fit of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sun was shining broadly, but none of its
rays seemed to fall on the sable garments of this
singular personage. In fact, though I saw him as
plainly as I now see you, Drayton, I was, nevertheless,
well aware that here was something more
or less than flesh and blood. It was a being of
another state than this mortal one of ours. I say
I saw him; and yet I do not believe that it was with
my natural eyesight. A deeper sense of vision had
been temporarily opened within me, and this spectre
came within its scope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For a spectre it was. General Burleigh, striding
bluffly along by the other side of his daughter, swinging
his cane, twisting his moustaches, and ever and
anon smiling and bowing to a passing friend, was
ludicrously unconscious of there being anything
supernatural in his vicinity. Moreover, I saw at
least twenty persons pass the apparition shoulder
to shoulder, evidently without seeing it; though they
would often shiver, and wrap their top-coats or shawls
more closely round them, as if a sudden blast of icy
air had penetrated them. All this time the three were
approaching slowly, and were now but little more
than twenty paces distant. I had not moved a step
since first coming in view of them, and had kept my
eyes fixed point-blank upon the apparition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this moment I was puzzled to observe that
the black-garmented figure was a good deal less distinctly
discernible than when it had been farther off.
The sun was still as bright as ever, the air as clear,
but the outline of the shape was blurred and undefined,
as though seen out of focus through a telescope.
General Burleigh now caught sight of me for the first
time, and his cordial gesture of salute caused Edna
quickly to raise her eyes. We saw despair in each
other&rsquo;s looks, and then she dropped her eyes again, and
moved wearily onward. Simultaneously with her glance
the spectre (which appeared to be as unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of everything save Edna and myself, as everyone
except us was of it)&mdash;the spectre also directed its
gaze at me. I can never forget that face, Drayton.
I seemed to grow older and more miserable as I confronted
it. And all the while it was getting less and
less perceptible; now it was magnified, clouded, and
distorted; but the devilish expression of it was still
recognisable. Now it faded or expanded into vagueness;
only a foggy shadow seemed gliding by Edna&rsquo;s
side; and when she was within ten paces, and her
father&rsquo;s voice was speaking out its hearty welcome to
me, every trace even of the shadow had disappeared;
nothing was left but that chilliness and horror of the
heart which I had felt the night previous, but now
vastly intensified, because I was no longer ignorant of
the cause of it. Edna and I would never again be
alone together. This devil was to haunt us henceforth,
mocking our love by its hideous mimicry and
derision, marring and polluting our most sacred
secrets, sickening our hearts and paralysing our hope
and reliance in each other. We could neither escape
it nor resist it; and its invisibility when we were
together was not the least fearful thing about it.
To see it, awful as it was, must be less unendurable
than to imagine it, unseen; and the certainty that, so
often as I left Edna, I should leave this devil in her
company, visible once more the moment he was out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of my reach, but never to be met and grappled with
hand to hand&mdash;this was hard to bear! Had ever
mortal man before such a rival?</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this, of course, was but dimly apprehended
by my mind at the time; but I had sufficient opportunity
to muse upon it afterwards. General Burleigh
seized my hand, and shook the head of his cane
at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shall be obliged to court-martial you, young
man! What have you been doing to my daughter,
sir? Why, no one can get a word or a smile out of
her, since you came with your tomfooleries! She
keeps all her good humour for you, confound you!
It&rsquo;s witchcraft&mdash;you&rsquo;ve bewitched my little girl with
your lockets and your necklaces and your tomfooleries!
You&rsquo;ve bewitched her&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll have you
court-martialed, and executed for witchcraft, by Jove!
Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; And with that he gripped
my hand again, and vowing that the club was the
only place for him since I had appeared with my
tomfooleries and witchcraft, he swung round on his
heel and strode away, his broad military shoulders
shaking with jollity; and left Edna alone with me&mdash;and
my rival!</p>

<p>&ldquo;We strolled off along Piccadilly, and I daresay
every man we met was envying me from the bottom
of his heart. But though her arm was in mine, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
knew I might as well have been miles away from her.
And we both were reticent of our words on all matters
lying near our hearts, as if that third presence had
been as palpable and visible as it was otherwise real.
We spoke constrainedly and coldly; nay, we even
tried not to <em>think</em> of our love or of our misery, lest it
might possess power to see our thoughts as well as
hear our voices. We walked on, seldom looking at
one another, for fear of catching a glimpse of it in
each other&rsquo;s eyes. I saw, however, that Edna still
wore her locket&mdash;indeed, she had told me, the night
before, that she would never take it off, until I bade
her do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So your father thinks you bewitched, Edna,&rsquo; I
said at length, trying to throw off the incubus a
little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am not very well, I think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He seemed to fancy the spell was connected
with that old locket,&rsquo; I continued; my very disinclination
to the subject driving me to tamper with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps it is,&rsquo; returned Edna listlessly, lifting her
hand for a moment to her throat. &lsquo;I am not quite
used to it yet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To witchcraft, do you mean? You have seen
no phantoms, have you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt her little hand clutch my arm with an
involuntary start. I looked down, and she met my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
eye with a blush, and at the same time with a terrified
shrinking expression that was bitter to behold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I see nothing with my open eyes,&rsquo; she said,
scarcely above a whisper; &lsquo;but at night&mdash;I cannot
help my dreams; and they follow me into the
day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was as I had thought, therefore; the spectre
was not objectively visible to her. She could not
get away from her own self, and hence could gain no
point of vantage whence her persecutor could be
seen. There was little doubt, nevertheless, that her
mental picture of him agreed with my ocular experience.
It seemed to me, on the whole, that her
burden must be far harder to bear than mine. There
is a kind of relief in being able to face a horror;
and my own feelings, since seeing this evil spirit
which was haunting us, had been in a certain sense
more tolerable, if more hopeless, than the night
before. But how did I know what agony she might
suffer? Even her innocent sleep was not sacred from
this evil thing; all her maiden reserve and delicacy
were outraged; she could be safe nowhere&mdash;no one
could protect her; and with me, who would have
given my life to please a whim of hers, her suffering
and exposure must be less endurable than anywhere
else. I could well understand her blush, poor girl&mdash;poor
girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Not for many years&mdash;not since, in fact, certain
sad experiences of my own early days&mdash;had I been
so deeply stirred as by this recital of Calbot&rsquo;s. His
voice had great compass and expression, and the
needs of his profession had given its natural powers
every cultivation. He had a way of dwelling on certain
words, and of occasionally pausing, or appearing
to hesitate, which greatly added to the effect of his
narrative. All this might be acquired by art, but
not so the ever and anon recurring falterings and
breaks, into which, as now, he was unexpectedly
betrayed. I felt that it was unwise in me to listen to
him, to sympathise with him, as I was doing; yet
could I not find it in my heart to stop him. All
fears of violence on his part had been for some time
past allayed. I was well aware that my encouragement
of his confidences could only result in my
passing a feverish uncomfortable night, and a listless
dismal morrow; and yet I forbore to interrupt
him. Ah! it is we old bachelors who have hearts
after all.</p>

<p>I blew my nose, Calbot cleared his throat, and
continued.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Drayton, I shan&rsquo;t keep you much longer.
From Piccadilly we turned into Bond Street, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
were walking up the side-walk on the left-hand side,
when suddenly Edna stopped, and clasped both her
hands round my arm. She uttered a low exclamation,
and trembled perceptibly. Her face, as I
looked at it, was quite rigid and colourless. I did
not know what was the matter, but fearing she was
about to swoon, I looked round for a cab. In so
doing my eye caught my own reflection in a mirror,
fixed at a shop entrance on the other side of the
street. It was in this direction that Edna also was
gazing, and the next moment I no longer wondered
at her ghastly aspect. Close by her shoulder appeared
the fantastic black-garmented figure which I had seen
awhile before in Park Lane. He was making the
wildest and most absurd gestures&mdash;grinning, throwing
about his arms, making profound mock obeisances,
and evidently in an ecstasy of enjoyment. I looked
suddenly round, but the place which should have been
occupied by the original of the reflection appeared
entirely empty. Looking back to the mirror, however,
there was the spectre again, actually capering
with ugly glee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meantime people were beginning to notice the
strange behaviour of Edna and myself, and I was
thankful when a passing cab enabled me to shield
her from their scrutiny. No sooner were we seated
than she fainted away, and only recovered a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
moments before we stopped at her door. As I
helped her out she looked me sadly in the face, and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come to me to-morrow afternoon&mdash;for the last
time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could say nothing against her decision,
Drayton; I felt we should be really more united,
living apart, than were we to force ourselves to outward
association. Our calamity was too strong for
us; separation might appease the mysterious malice
of the phantom, and cause him to return whither he
belonged. The persecution of our long-dead ancestors
now recurred to me, as I had read it a few
months before in those dusty old documents, and I
could not help seeing a strange similarity between
their fate and ours. Yet we had an advantage in
not being married, and in having the warning of
their history before us. You see,&rdquo; observed Calbot,
somewhat bitterly, &ldquo;even I can talk of advantages!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to her house to-day and had a short
interview. I cannot tell you in detail what we said,
but it seems to me as though the memory of it
would gradually oust all other memories from my
mind. I told her that passage of history. We
agreed to part&mdash;for ever in this world. I took back
the chain and locket which I had given her but so
short a time before. We said good-bye, in cold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
distant words. We could not gratify the evil spirit,
which we knew was watching us, by any embrace or
show of grief and passion. We could be proud in
our despair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment, Calbot,&rdquo; said I, interrupting him
at this point; &ldquo;you say she gave you back the
locket?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it in your possession now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is at the bottom of the Thames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! And have you or Miss Burleigh seen
anything of your phantom since then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget that we parted only this afternoon.
But I understand your question. No, Drayton, it is
there that the fate of our ancestors gives us timely
warning. We must never meet again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider the cases parallel; and besides,&rdquo;
I added, with a glance at my <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>, &ldquo;there is perhaps
another point to be considered. However, finish your
story, if there be any more to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little more, and then my story will be finished
indeed! I am going with the new expedition to the
North Pole, and it will be my own fault if I return.
Well, after leaving her, I came straight downstairs
and hurried out. I felt as though I must go mad, or
kill someone&mdash;myself perhaps. As I stood on the
doorstep, mechanically buttoning up my ulster, I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that creeping sickening chill once more, and knew
that the unholy Thing had passed me. I looked
sharply about, and in a moment or two I saw it, as
plainly as ever. It stood on the sunlit pavement,
about fifty yards away, and appeared to be beckoning
me to approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I watched it for perhaps a minute, and then a
sudden fury took possession of me. My hatred
against this devil which had blighted my life and
Edna&rsquo;s must have leapt up in my eyes, for I fancied,
from the way the phantom leered at me, that he
meant to claim a sort of relationship with me&mdash;as
though I were become a devil too. Well, if I were a
devil, perhaps I might be able to inflict some torture
on this my fellow. I sprang down the steps, and set
off towards it. It waited until I had passed over more
than half the intervening distance, and then it suddenly
turned and walked onward before me. So a
chase began.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Calbot,&rdquo; remonstrated I; &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t mean to tell me you ran after it&mdash;in the face of
all London too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have followed it to its own hell if it had
led me there,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;At first it stalked along
swiftly but easily, only occasionally cutting a grotesque
caper in the air, with a flourish of its arms and
legs. It kept always the same distance in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
me&mdash;with no effort could I lessen the interval. Nevertheless,
I gradually increased my speed almost to a
run, much to the apparent delight of the hobgoblin,
who skipped with frantic glee over the cold pavements,
occasionally half facing about to wave me on.
It turned the corner of Piccadilly, and I lost sight of
it for a moment; but, hurrying up, there it was again,
a short distance up the street. It made me a profound
mock obeisance, and immediately set off anew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I need not tell you, the figure which I was
pursuing was visible only to myself. The street was
full of people, there were all the usual noise, bustle,
and gaiety of the city at that hour; but though it
passed through the midst of the crowd, in all the
fantastic singularity of its costume and manner, no
one stepped out of its way or turned to gaze at it.
That it should be so terrible a reality to me, and at
the same time so completely non-existent to the rest
of the world, affected me strangely. Here was a new
bond of relationship between me and it. My misery
and I were one; but the link which united us was a
cap of invisibility for the demon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> was not invisible, however, nor unnoticed. I
was conscious that everyone was staring at me&mdash;and
no wonder! I must have presented an odd spectacle,
hurrying onward with no apparent object, and with
an expression of face which may well have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
startling to behold. But so long as no attempt was
made to stop me, I was indifferent to remark. I had
determined to follow my black friend in the plumed
hat, no matter where the chase might lead me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pace grew quicker and quicker. We went
down the Haymarket, and were now in the throng of
the Strand. All the places which I know so well
passed by like remembered dreams. They seemed
illusions, and the only real substance in the world was
this Thing that I pursued. The dark shape continued
to glide forward with easy speed, ever and anon giving
me a glimpse of the pallid malignance of its evil
visage; but my own breath was beginning to come
hard, and the difficulty of forcing a path through the
press became greater as we neared the heart of the
city. Passing beneath Temple Bar, the spectre
stopped a moment and stamped its foot imperiously,
at the same time beckoning to me with an impatient
gesture. I sprang forward, yearning to grapple with
it; but it was gone again, and seemed to flit like a
shadow along the sidewalk. Its merriment, however,
now forsook all bounds&mdash;it appeared to be in a
ceaseless convulsion of chuckling laughter. We fled
onward, but so absorbed in my pursuit had I now
become, that I recollect nothing distinctly until the
tower of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> G&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s came into view. I think
a premonition of what was to occur entered my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
mind then. The hobgoblin disappeared&mdash;seemingly
through the iron railing of the contracted graveyard
which bounds the northern side of the church. I
came up to the railing and looked within. It was
sitting on an ancient headstone, blackened by London
smoke and worn by time; it sat with its elbows on
its knees, and its head in its hands. A sombre
shadow fell about it, which the cheerful sunshine
could not penetrate; but its awful eyes emitted a
dusky phosphorescent glare, dimly illuminating the
leering features. As I looked, a change came over
them&mdash;they were now those of a corpse already
mouldering in decay, crumbling into nothingness
before my eyes. The whole figure gradually faded
or darkened away: I cannot tell how or when it
vanished. Presently I was staring fixedly at an old
tombstone, with a name and a date upon it; but the
churchyard was empty.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Of my own accord I now reproduced my decanter
of port-wine, and Calbot and I finished it before
either of us spoke another word.</p>

<p>What he was thinking of meanwhile I know not;
for my part, I was endeavouring to put in order a
number of disjointed ideas, imbibed at various epochs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
during this evening, whose logical arrangement, I
was convinced, would go far towards elucidating
much of the mystery. As to the positively supernatural
part of Calbot&rsquo;s experience, of course I had
no way of accounting for that; but I fancied there
were materials at hand tolerably competent to raise a
ghost, allowing such a thing as a ghost to be possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad, Calbot,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;that you came to
me. Your good sense&mdash;or instinct, perhaps&mdash;directed
you aright. Do not despair: I should not be surprised
were we to manage between us to discover that your
happiness, so far from being at an end, was just on
the point of establishing itself upon a trustworthy
foundation.&rdquo; Calbot shook his head gloomily. &ldquo;Well,
well,&rdquo; resumed I, &ldquo;let us see. In the first place&mdash;as
regards that locket. It will perhaps surprise you to
learn that I had heard of it before you came this
evening&mdash;had read quite a minute description of it, in
fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; demanded my friend, raising his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will appear later. I must first ask you
whether, in the old family documents you spoke of,
the personal appearance of this Archibald Armstrong
was particularly delineated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly know; I have no recollection of any
especial passage&mdash;and yet I fancy it must have been
given with some fulness; because when I saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
hobgoblin, its costume and aspect seemed curiously
familiar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And had I seen it, there is little doubt in my
mind that I should have recognised it also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Calbot, sitting upright in
his chair, &ldquo;how happens that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, I am merely collecting evidence.
Now, have you any reason to suppose that a
connection of any sort&mdash;friendly, business, or other&mdash;subsisted
between your unhappy ancestor and this
Armstrong previous to the former&rsquo;s marriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean whether he was under any obligations
to Armstrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may have been&mdash;but the idea is new to me.
How&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not done yet. Now, did it never occur to
you&mdash;or, I should say, does it not seem probable&mdash;that
the locket which you had found hidden away
in your mother&rsquo;s jewel-box was in some way connected
with the family tragedy you told me of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought of it, Drayton; there is no
difficulty in imagining such a thing; the trouble is,
we haven&rsquo;t the slightest evidence of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about to say,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;that there is
direct evidence of precisely such a locket having been
bought, in the latter part of the seventeenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
by precisely such a looking man as the hobgoblin
you saw to-day. It was to be a wedding-gift to the
woman he was to marry the next day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drayton!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That woman deceived him, and eloped on the
eve of her marriage with a protÃ©gÃ© of his. He professed
forgiveness, and sent the locket as a pledge
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Odd!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He died in 1698, and his last recorded words
were a curse invoked upon those whom he had before
professed to pardon&mdash;upon them and their posterity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Drayton&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my opinion that his forgiveness was merely
a cloak to his deadly and unrelenting hatred. It is
my opinion, Calbot, that the pledge he gave was
poisonous with evil and malicious influences. The
locket was made of tourmaline, which has mysterious
properties. No doubt he believed it a veritable
witch&rsquo;s talisman; and from the sufferings which
afterwards befell his enemies (not to speak of your
own experience), one might almost fancy witchcraft to
be not entirely a delusion after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One might, indeed! But if, as you seem to
imply, this locket enabled Armstrong to persecute
Calbot and his wife, why did not they send it back or
destroy it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply because they were not aware of its evil
nature, and fancied that Armstrong&rsquo;s (if it were his)
profession of forgiveness had been genuine. Very
likely Mrs. Calbot habitually wore it on her bosom, as
Miss Burleigh did again yesterday, more than a
century later. The persecutor must have been a
devil incarnate, from the time he learnt his lady&rsquo;s
faithlessness until his death; and after that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A plain devil. But to come to the point, you
think that the locket was the sole medium of his
power over them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly. Then, after their death, it remained
in the family, but never happened to be used
again: it is not a jewel to catch the eye by any
means. It remained perdu until you fished it out for
Miss Burleigh, and thereby stirred up the old hobgoblin
to play his devilish tricks once more. But by
a lucky combination of accidents you parted with her
in time; she returned you the locket, thus freeing
<em>herself</em> from the spectre; and you, by throwing it in
the Thames, have secured him against ever being able
to make his appearance again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so, Drayton,&rdquo; cried Calbot in great
excitement. &ldquo;I remember, too, that when I gave her
the locket she promised fealty <em>to the giver</em>! Now, in
fact, not I but this cursed Armstrong was the real
giver; and so Edna was actually surrendering herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to his power. But, supposing your explanation
correct, why may not Edna and I come together
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear fellow,&rdquo; replied I, as I lit another
Cabana, &ldquo;unless you have acquired a very decided
aversion to each other during the last few hours, I
really don&rsquo;t see why you shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drayton, I&rsquo;m afraid to believe this true! Tell
me how you came upon your evidence, and what
degree of reliance may be placed upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him briefly about the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>, and added the
conviction (at which I had arrived during his narrative)
that it must have been sent to me by my former
friend, Armstrong&rsquo;s executor; and probably comprised
the very papers which I had made an ineffectual
attempt to secure at the auction sale. &ldquo;The
only lame point about the matter,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;is, that
the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> is wholly anonymous. All the names are
blanks, and though I have no doubt, now, that they
are Armstrong, Burleigh, and Calbot, there is no
direct proof of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My friend&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;There, it may be only a
coincidence after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! a coincidence indeed! If you have
credulity enough to believe in such a &lsquo;coincidence&rsquo;
as that, you have certainly mistaken your profession.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were a lawyer,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;you would
know that there is no limit to the strangeness of
coincidences. But let me see the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is there on the table, at your elbow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Calbot turned and took it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this&mdash;it&rsquo;s wet, soaking wet!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Drayton, I&rsquo;m afraid I must have cracked that old
vase of yours. It has been leaking, and the table is
flooded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was too true. The precious water of life had
been preserved through so many generations merely
for the sake of spoiling the morocco of my study
table at last. Vanished were my hopes of earthly
immortality. Cautiously lifting the vase, in the hope
that somewhat of the precious ichor might yet be
saved, the whole bottom fell out. Calbot was sorry,
of course, but he had no conception of the extent of
the misfortune. He observed that the vase could
easily be mended, as if the vase were the chief
treasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said I, rather soberly, after we
had sopped up the inestimable elixir, as well as we
could, with our handkerchiefs. &ldquo;I shall die an eternity
or two the sooner, and shall have to get my table new
covered, that&rsquo;s all. I hope, Calbot, that the good
which your visit here has done you, will be a small
fraction as great as the loss it has inflicted on me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Well, and how has the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> come out of the scrape?
All washed out, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a penitent eye Calbot took it up once more,
and ran his eye over the last page. I saw his expression
change. He knit his brows&mdash;looked up at me
with a quick questioning glance&mdash;looked back to the
page, and finally said: &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems you had filled in the blanks before I
came?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the first four letters of the alphabet. Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the names in full!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What names?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Drayton, the first thing I looked at was
this record of &lsquo;ondyinge Hatred,&rsquo; <abbr title="etcetera">&amp;c.</abbr> It contains all
the four names&mdash;yours as one of the witnesses of
Armstrong&rsquo;s signature. They are written out in pale
red ink, as plain as can be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had jumped from my chair and taken the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>
from Calbot&rsquo;s hand. It was impossible&mdash;it was inconceivable,
but it was true. The page was thoroughly
wetted through, but there were the three names&mdash;the
<em>four</em> names, for my own was added, in the character
of compiler of the work&mdash;plainly traced out in light
red ink. Could I have done it in a fit of abstraction?
No, for the chirography was not mine&mdash;it was identical
with all the rest of the writing. In my utter bewilderment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
I raised my eyes to the wall, where hung the
picture of my ecclesiastical ancestor&mdash;he, the alchemist,
the busybody, the death-bed confidant, the suspected
wizard&mdash;and my own namesake&mdash;we were the only
two Toxophiluses in all the line of Draytons. Once
more, for the third or fourth time that evening, it
struck me that he looked excessively knowing and sly.</p>

<p>Who can analyse the lightning evolutions of
human thought? I knew the truth before I could
explain it. It crystallised in my brain all in a
moment. A glance at the front of the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>, which
had not been wetted, confirmed me.</p>

<p>I threw down the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>, clapped Calbot on the
shoulder, and burst into an immoderate fit of laughter,
which his astonished and concerned aspect served
only to aggravate. It was some minutes before I
could speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a simple matter after all,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;My old
progenitor, there on the wall, was a friend&mdash;confidential
friend&mdash;of Armstrong&rsquo;s. It was he who
wrote that <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr>, and left the blanks, which are not
blanks, but names written in invisible ink. He prepared,
then, the chemical reagent for the purpose of
making the invisible writing visible whenever the time
should come. Perhaps he meant to apply it himself
some day; but, unluckily, death snatched him all
unawares from the scene of his pious intrigues. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
<abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> got into the hands of Armstrong&rsquo;s heirs (from
whom I this day received it). The reagent stayed
with the Draytons. This evening you came and
brought the two together in your own inimitable style.
You see, wherever the paper is wet, the blanks are
filled in: the untouched parts are blanks still. Oh
John, John! I wish this had happened before I
printed my article on &lsquo;Unrecognisable Truths:&rsquo; it is
a peculiarly apt illustration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you,&rdquo; said Calbot, after a pause,
&ldquo;that there was nothing in the world so strange as
coincidences?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the hobgoblin still unaccounted for,&rdquo;
answered I; &ldquo;but I have done my part; I leave the
rest to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ast">*****</p>

<p>The next day but one came a note from my friend.
It ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;What did I do at your rooms last night? Was
I queer at all? I had intended calling on you that
day, to tell you that Edna and I were going to be
married April 1st, and to get you for my best man.
<em>Did</em> I tell you? Because, if not, I do now. The fact
is, you see, I had been reading over some curious old
family documents (I think I spoke to you about them),
and then I went up to Edna&rsquo;s and frightened her half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to death with telling her ghost stories about the locket
I&rsquo;d given her as a betrothal gift (a queer little thing it
is. Did I ever mention it to you?) Well, going
home I met young De Quincey, and he proposed&mdash;he&rsquo;s
always up to some devilry or other&mdash;he proposed
doing something which I shall never do again; I was
a fool to try it at all, but I had no notion how it
would act. I&rsquo;m afraid I may have annoyed you. I
have an idea I upset your ink-bottle, and that I got it
into my head that the ghost story I had been telling
Edna was true. How was it? I know I felt deathly
sick the next morning; I&rsquo;m not certain whether it
was the port-wine I drank, or that confounded
hasheesh that I took with young De Quincey. I
promised Edna I&rsquo;d never take any more. Well, you
won&rsquo;t object to being my best man, will you?</p>

<p class="sgn">&ldquo;J. C.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>So far from explaining the essential mystery&mdash;the
Ghostly Rival&mdash;this letter of John&rsquo;s only makes it, to
my mind, more inscrutable than ever. Talk about
coincidences! For my part, I prefer to believe in
ghosts.</p>

<h2>MRS. GAINSBOROUGH&rsquo;S<br />
DIAMONDS.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Superb!</span> I don&rsquo;t know when I have seen finer,
Tom, really!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Tom, complacently handling his left
whisker. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added, after a moment or two,
&ldquo;and thereby hangs a tale!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was after dinner&mdash;after one of Tom Gainsborough&rsquo;s
snug, inimitable little dinners; only we three&mdash;Tom,
his wife, and myself: and a couple of negro
attendants, as well trained and less overpowering than
the best of the native English stock; and that charming
dining-room, just big enough, just cool enough,
soft-carpeted, clear-walled, and the steady white
radiance of the argand burners descending upon the
damask tablecloth, crowned with fruits and flowers;
and an agreeable shadow over the rest of the room, so
that those sable servitors could perform their noiseless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
evolutions unseen; and a pervading sense of
unconscious good-breeding and unobtrusive wealth;
and&mdash;&mdash;but I will not speak of the china; I will not
descant upon Tom&rsquo;s wines; I don&rsquo;t wish to make
other people envious. Only it was all inexpressibly
good, from fascinating Mrs. Gainsborough and her
diamonds, down.</p>

<p>I felt a peculiar interest in Mrs. Gainsborough,
because, in addition to her other attractions, she was
a countrywoman of mine&mdash;that is to say, an American.
She was brunette, slender, graceful; with a weird
expression of the eyes under straight black eyebrows,
an expression which somehow suggested mesmerism&mdash;or
perhaps a liability on her part to be mesmerised;
faultless throat and shoulders; and hands and wrists
that she could talk with, almost. Where had Tom
found her? I never had thought of asking him; she
was a Virginian very likely&mdash;an &ldquo;F.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;V.&rdquo;; and they
had doubtless met upon the Continent. This was the
first occasion on which I had seen her in her diamonds.
Indeed, Tom and she had only been married a year
or two, and had been settled in that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijou</i> residence of
theirs scarcely six months; and this was but my
third or fourth dinner there. Well, her diamonds became
her, and she them; they somehow matched that
weird light in her eyes; and I told Tom as much when,
after dinner, she withdrew and left us over our wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And thereby hangs a tale,&rdquo; repeated he, thoughtfully
reaching his hand towards the decanter, and
filling my glass and his own.</p>

<p>Now, it seemed to me entirely in accordance with
young Mrs. Gainsborough&rsquo;s &ldquo;style&rdquo; that there should
have been something odd and romantic in the circumstances
of her first acquaintance with Tom, and
that diamonds should be mixed up with it. Therefore
I was more than willing to give ear to the strange
story which he proceeded to relate to me. Imagine
the servants dismissed, a fresh lump of coal in the
grate, the decanter between us, and our legs and
elbows disposed in the most comfortable manner
possible. Then, this is the story.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;The diamonds, you must know, have been ever so
long in our family. It is said they were brought from
India, in the time of Marco Polo, by an ancestor of
mine. But that is neither here nor there; and sure
enough they were only put into their present shape
quite recently. I can remember when half of them
were uncut, or cut in some barbarous oriental manner,
picturesque enough, but not fashionable. And some
were mounted as nose-rings, some as clasps, some in
the hilts of daggers, and in all sorts of other ways.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
When I was a child, I was sometimes allowed to play
with some of the loose ones, as a treat; until, at last,
I contrived to lose one of the biggest. You may not
believe it, but the governor actually horsed me and
gave me a birching; and the diamonds were locked
up from that day. It was only a few years ago that
my dear mother, now no more, got them out, and
insisted upon their being made up into a regular set
by some skilful jeweller. We were thinking of going
to Rome at the time, to spend six or eight months,
and the first idea was to give the job to Castellani.
But then it appeared that my mother had got her eye
fixed upon a certain man in Paris, whom she had
been told was the first lapidary in Europe. He, and
none but he, should set our diamonds. You know
my mother generally had her way; and she had it in
this case. The fellow certainly did understand his
business; his work was well done, as you may have
noticed this evening. A queer, pale, nervous little
chap he was; not a Frenchman at all, but a Saxon,
born in Dresden, I believe, or some village in that
neighbourhood. His name was Rudolph&mdash;Heinrich
Rudolph. He lived and worked in a little dark shop
in the Latin Quarter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He and I became quite intimate. You see, I had
been commissioned to attend to this diamond business,
and to remain in Paris until it was done. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to watch it through all its stages, and be sure that
my mother&rsquo;s directions regarding the style of the
setting were accurately followed. When all was
finished, I was to pay the bill and bring the diamonds
on to Rome, where the family would by that time
be established. Well, I was a young fellow, and
probably I was not so much cast down at the prospect
of spending a month or two alone in Paris as
you might suppose. But I doubt whether I should
have attended to my ostensible business so faithfully
as I actually did, had I not been so greatly taken
with my little friend Rudolph. He and I twigged
one another, as boys say, from the first. I used to
sit and watch him work for hours at a time; and as
he worked, he would talk; and very queer captivating
talk a good deal of it was. He was a thorough artist
and enthusiast, and seemed to care for nothing outside
of his profession. He did not appear to me to
be in the way of making much money, and it occurred
to me that it might be acceptable were I, in an unobtrusive
way, to introduce him to some wealthy
customers. I knew few people in Paris; but there
was a Mr. Birchmore, an American gentleman, staying
at my hotel, with whom I had forgathered over
a cup of coffee and a cigar once or twice: he was
a handsome middle-aged man, with an atmosphere
of refined affluence about him such as would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
befitted a duke. Not a bit like your traditional Yankee;
in fact, I&rsquo;m not sure that I should have suspected him,
if I hadn&rsquo;t seen his address&mdash;&lsquo;Fifth Avenue, New
York City, U.S.A.&rsquo;&mdash;in the hotel register, about a
week after my arrival. He was an agreeable man
enough, though not at all the sort to take liberties
with; however, I made up my mind that I would
get him to Rudolph&rsquo;s on the first pretext that
offered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I had an excellent pretext before long.
Mr. Birchmore came into the cafÃ© one afternoon,
with rather an annoyed look, and made some
inquiries of the waiter. FranÃ§ois raised his eyebrows
and shrugged his shoulders; there was some
further conference, and then he and Mr. Birchmore
began searching about the floor of the room. It presently
transpired that he had lost a diamond out of
his ring, which had contained three matched brilliants.
It was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the loss of the stone itself,&rsquo; said
Mr. Birchmore at last, sitting down near my table;
&lsquo;but it&rsquo;s one of a set, matched with great difficulty,
and I&rsquo;m afraid I may never replace it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here was my opportunity. I set forth the wisdom,
skill, and resources of my little Saxon friend in glowing
colours; mentioned the work he was doing for
me, and declared that if any man in Europe could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
help Mr. Birchmore to repair his loss, Rudolph was
he. Mr. Birchmore at first paid little heed to my
representations; but finally I induced him to accompany
me to the Latin Quarter, and at least make the
attempt. The next morning, accordingly, we set
forth; and as we sauntered along the wide pleasant
boulevards, our conversation became more free and
affable than it had been hitherto. I found my companion
could be exceedingly entertaining when he
chose it, and had a vast fund of experience and
adventure to draw upon. He had been almost everywhere;
he had made himself familiar with all varieties
of civilised and uncivilised men; as a matter of course,
too, he was a versatile linguist. The only direction
in which he gave any evidence of comparative deficiency
was in that of literature and the fine arts.
His life had been essentially an active one; he cared
little for Tennyson and Swinburne, for Matthew
Arnold and Carlyle. He had, however, read and
appreciated &lsquo;Macbeth,&rsquo; and some others of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays; and he was well acquainted with
several of the romances of &lsquo;Unabashed Defoe.&rsquo; I
did not discover all this in the course of that one
stroll over to the Latin Quarter, but it leaked out
during our subsequent acquaintance, which was
destined to become more intimate and prolonged
than I had any idea of then. As I have intimated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Mr. Birchmore was quite frank and open in his talk,
except upon one topic&mdash;himself. Of his inner life
and circumstances I could learn nothing. Though he
never was obtrusively reticent, yet he contrived never
to refer to his own private affairs. I could not satisfy
myself whether he were married or single, whether he
were a Catholic or Atheist&mdash;hardly whether he were
rich or poor. Some shadow of grief, some incubus of
fear or calamity, seemed to overwhelm him, and impose
silence. The most I could do was to draw inferences;
and my inference was that he was a bachelor, a
millionaire, a sceptic, and a man who, at some period
of his life, had committed, either deliberately or by
force of circumstances, a terrible crime! You will see
presently how far my estimate was from the truth, or
how near to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, I am anticipating, as it is. We arrived
in due time at Rudolph&rsquo;s little shop, and I introduced
him to Birchmore. I had previously told the latter
about my diamonds, and now I made Rudolph produce
them. The man of the world examined the
gems with evident interest, and with a knowledge
of their value and qualities which surprised me, and
caused the little jeweller to eye my friend with a
jealous keenness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;These are all Indian stones,&rsquo; was Birchmore&rsquo;s
first remark. &lsquo;There is not an American among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
them&mdash;or stay! What is this? neither an American
nor an Indian! An African, I declare, and one of
the finest I have seen!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Der Herr hat recht!&rsquo; muttered Rudolph, with a
glance at me. &lsquo;Er versteht ja alles.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You know German?&rsquo;&mdash;he says, &lsquo;What you
don&rsquo;t know about diamonds isn&rsquo;t worth knowing,&rsquo;
I put in. Birchmore nodded with a half smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I ought to know something about precious
stones,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I spent three years in a diamond
mine, for one thing.&rsquo; He seemed on the point of
saying more, but checked himself, and went on
scrutinising the stones, most of which were already
in their new setting. &lsquo;A costly parure that,&rsquo; he
remarked at length. &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t sell for a penny
under thirty thousand pounds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Five hundred eighty-five thousand francs, with
the setting,&rsquo; replied Rudolph, to whom the words
had been addressed. &lsquo;Monsieur&rsquo;s estimate would
have been correct, but that this stone here is a little
off colour, and this one has a slight flaw, which is
now in part concealed by the setting.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You travel under proper precautions, I trust?&rsquo;
said Birchmore, after a pause, turning gravely to me.
&lsquo;I know the confidence you young fellows have in
your courage and cleverness; but a dozen or a score
of thieves might conspire together for such a prize as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
this, and against their skill and address no single man
would stand a chance. Ah! I know something of it.
I was robbed once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do tell me about it!&rsquo; I exclaimed, with an
impulsive betrayal of interest that made me smile
the next moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Another time,&rsquo; said he, shaking his head; and
presently he added: &lsquo;You will pardon me for presuming
to counsel you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear sir, I am much obliged to you. My
idea is that the simplest precautions are the best.
I shall carry the stones in an inner pocket, and I
shall go armed. No one will suspect me; and if I
am attacked, I shall make a good defence at all
events.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Birchmore said nothing more, and indeed
seemed scarcely to listen to my remarks. I now
suggested to him that he might show Rudolph his
ring. He put his hand to his waistcoat pocket, and
gave a half-suppressed ejaculation of disappointment
and annoyance. He had left the ring at home!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No matter; I will call to-morrow, Herr Rudolph,&rsquo;
he observed. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt I shall find what I want
here, if anywhere. Good-morning&mdash;that is, if you are
ready, Mr. Gainsborough. By the way, Rudolph, I
suppose you put your treasures in a safe at night?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, by all means, Herr,&rsquo; replied the little Saxon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
&lsquo;And I have a watchman also, who guards all night
long.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A prudent fellow: yes, that will do,&rsquo; murmured
Mr. Birchmore, in an undertone to himself. Then,
with a parting nod and smile, to which the jeweller
did not respond, he sauntered out, I following him.
We walked back to the hotel. I did not see him
again until after dinner, when he offered me a cigar;
and when we had smoked together awhile in silence,
he said abruptly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found that stone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The diamond out of my ring. In my trouser
pocket, of all places in the world! Fell out while I
was groping for my keys, I suppose. Sorry to have
raised false hopes in your friend Rudolph. By the
way, he&rsquo;ll have finished that job of yours before very
long?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In about a week, I fancy. I shall be sorry to
leave Paris.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes? Well, it is a nice place; but one gets
tired of the nicest places in time. I do. I like to
be moving.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall have a month to spend on my way to
Rome. This is almost my first experience of the
Continent. I wish I had some travelling companion
who knew the ropes.&rsquo; This hint I let fall in the hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
that he might propose to join me; but as he made no
rejoinder, I at length ventured to put it more plainly.
I gave a rough sketch of the route I proposed to
follow, asked his opinion upon it, and finally said
that, should his inclination lead him also in that
direction, I should be very glad of his company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;m obliged to you,&rsquo; replied Mr.
Birchmore, after a pause of some moments. &lsquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t pay a man a better compliment than to
ask him to travel with you; and I would accept
your offer as frankly and fearlessly as you make
it, only&mdash;well, the fact is, I&rsquo;m not so entirely at
my own disposal as I may appear to you to be.
I have been through a good many experiences in
life, and some of the consequences are upon me
still. When you have reached my age&mdash;if you ever
do reach it&mdash;you will understand me better. I
suppose I may be fifteen years your senior; well,
fifteen years means a good deal&mdash;a good deal.&rsquo; He
puffed a meditative cloud or two, and then added,
&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not hurt? You see how it is? I would
really like to accompany you&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I warmly disavowed all resentment
and felt inwardly ashamed of having forced him,
by the freedom of my advances, into making this
explanation. Meanwhile, I could not help liking
him better than ever, and feeling more than ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
interested, not to say curious, about him. It was
now certain that some mystery or other attached to
him. I cast covert glances at him, in the vain
attempt to read something of his secret through
his outward aspect. But he was inscrutable, or
rather, there was nothing especially noticeable in
him. His face, as I have said, was handsome in
its contours; he wore a heavy moustache and a
short pointed beard on his chin. His forehead was
wide across the temples, but low; and dark brown
hair, rather stiff, and streaked here and there with
gray, grew thickly over his head. His hands were
large, and hairy up to the second joints of the
fingers, but they were finely and powerfully formed,
and the fingers tapered beautifully, with nails smoothly
cut and polished. In figure he was above the medium
size, and appeared strongly built, though he had
complained to me more than once of rheumatism
or some other bodily failing. In walking, he took
rather short steps for a tall man, and without any
swaying of the shoulders; his hands being generally
thrust in the side pockets of his coat, and his face
inclined towards the ground. But his eyes, large,
bright, and restless, were his most remarkable feature.
They appeared to take note of everything: they
were seldom fixed and never introspective. Compared
with the general immobility of the rest of his countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
these eyes of Mr. Birchmore seemed to have
a life of their own&mdash;and a very intense and watchful
one. Whenever they met mine fully (which was
but seldom, and then only for a moment at a time)
I was conscious of a kind of start or thrill, as if a
fine spray of icy water had swept my face. What
had those eyes looked upon? or what was it that
lurked behind them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We may run across each other again&mdash;hope we
may,&rsquo; said Mr. Birchmore, when he shook hands
with me at parting, a few days later. &lsquo;Glad to
have met you, Mr. Gainsborough&mdash;very glad, sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thanks; I am glad to have met you. Your
acquaintance has profited me not a little.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, as to that,&rsquo; said Mr. Birchmore, with a
smile, and one of those startling straightforward
glances into my eyes, &lsquo;as to that, the profit will
have been mutual, to say the least of it. Good-bye!&rsquo;</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;My route to Italy was rather a roundabout one.
Instead of running down to Marseilles and so on
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viÃ¢</i> Civita Vecchia to Rome, I set off eastwards,
and crossed Germany, passing through Cologne,
Frankfort-on-the-Main, and Nuremberg; thence I
proceeded to Leipzig, and at length brought up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Dresden. It was my intention to go from there
southwards through Switzerland to Venice, and thus
to make my approach to the Eternal City.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dresden, however, detained me longer than I
had expected. It was in August that I reached
it: there were not many people in town, but I was
delighted with the Gallery, with the picturesque
sweep of the river, and with the green shade and
good music of the Grosser Garten. There were
several charming drives, too, in the neighbourhood;
and as for the beer, it was really a revelation to a
man who had never known anything less heavy
and solid than Allsopp&rsquo;s pale ale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had put up at the Hotel de Saxe, a broadsided
old building on one side of a large irregular &lsquo;platz,&rsquo;
called, I believe, the Neumarkt. My landlord, who
was a young gentleman of great personal attractions,
interested himself a good deal about my amusements;
and one day he happened to ask me
whether I had visited a region known as Saxon
Switzerland. This, it appeared, was a mountainous
district some twenty miles up the Elbe, in
which was solved the problem of putting the
greatest amount of romantic picturesqueness into the
smallest possible compass. It was a land of savage
rocks, wild precipices, and profound gorges, conveniently
grouped within the limits of a good day&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
tramp. It comprised all the sublime and startling
features of your Yellowstone Valley in California
with an area about equal to the summit of one of the
table bluffs in that region.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I packed my valise for a sojourn of two or three
days among these pocket Alps, put my diamonds in
that secure inner pocket, and took a droschkey for
the railway station. The trip to Schandau (the principal
village of Saxon Switzerland) can also be made
by steamer; but after discussing the pros and cons of
rival routes with my host of the hotel the evening
previous, I had decided to go by rail, which provides
nearly half as much pretty scenery as the river road,
and takes up less than a fourth as much time. I
alighted at the station door somewhat late, and
having given my trunk in charge to a porter, was
hurrying to get my ticket, when my attention was
caught by a young lady, who was standing on the
platform in an attitude that bespoke suspense and
anxiety. Her veil was down, but from the slender
elegance of her figure and the harmonious perfection
of her costume, I could not doubt that her face was
beautiful. Evidently she was not a German; had she
been a thought less tastefully dressed, I should have
said she was an English girl; as it was, she might be
either an Austrian or an American. Even then, I
rather inclined to the latter hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She appeared to be entirely alone; but she was
scanning with ill-concealed eagerness the crowd that
was entering the station, as if in search of a familiar
face. When her glance fell upon me, I fancied that
she took an impulsive step in my direction; but she
checked herself immediately, and looked away. While
I was hastily debating within myself whether or not
it would be &lsquo;the thing&rsquo; for me to go up and ask her
if she needed any assistance, I saw a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">dientsman</i>, or
carrier, come up the steps, and taking off his cap,
deliver her a note. She tore it nervously open, threw
back her veil impatiently, and ran her eyes over the
contents. Beautiful she was, indeed! My anticipations
had been behind the truth on that score. Such
strange, mystical, dark eyes underneath level black
eyebrows I had never seen. But just then there was
an expression of dismay and distress in them that
made me half forget to remember their fascination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She now addressed the carrier, seemingly in
broken German, for he evidently did not well understand
her, and the answer he made appeared to
increase her embarrassment. Her slender foot tapped
the stone pavement; she read the note once more,
crushed it up in her hand, and then her arms fell
listlessly at her sides with an air almost of despair.
She looked this way and that helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this time several persons besides myself had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
observed her bewilderment, and I thought I perceived
that a certain fat old Jew, wearing a number of
glittering rings and a very massive watch-chain, was
inclined to take advantage of it. This decided me on
my course of action: I came quickly forward, as if I
had just caught sight of her, and lifting my hat with
an air of respectful acquaintanceship, I said in
French:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If mademoiselle will permit me, I may perhaps
be of some use.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her veil, either accidentally or of design, dropped
again over her face as she turned it towards me. I
knew that she was scrutinising me with a woman&rsquo;s
intuitive insight, and I tried to look as guileless and
respectful as I am sure I felt. In a moment she
asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Monsieur est-il FranÃ§ais?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m an Englishman,&rsquo; I answered, blushing a
little, I dare say, at her implied criticism of my
imperfect accent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I am glad! I, too, am almost English&mdash;I
am American. But I don&rsquo;t know how I can be
helped, really!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some friend has missed an appointment&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, indeed! Oh dear! it&rsquo;s worse than that.
It&rsquo;s my father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You were going by the train&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There has been some stupid mistake. I&rsquo;m sure
I don&rsquo;t know what I shall do. We had arranged to
start at ten o&rsquo;clock this morning, and I started first,
because I wanted to do some shopping on the way
down. I understood that we were to rendezvous
here. But he did not come at ten, and I sent a
dientsman to the hotel; and now he has brought
word from the hotel-keeper that papa started by the
ten o&rsquo;clock steamboat. I had not understood that it
was to be the steamboat, you see; and I&rsquo;m left here
all alone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But if you took the next train, you would still
arrive two or three hours before him; that is&mdash;may I
ask where you were going?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I think Schandau is the name of the
place.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Schandau? Oh, then it&rsquo;s all right. There is a
train starts immediately.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;but&mdash;no; I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t do that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was puzzled. &lsquo;Perhaps you would like to
telegraph him to come back here for you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to telegraph, so that he
would get it; besides&mdash;&mdash; But, excuse me, sir. You
are very kind; but I won&rsquo;t trouble you with my
affairs. I dare say I shall get on very well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She turned away with a slight bow; but she was
so evidently nonplussed, that I determined to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
another effort to gain her confidence. There was not
much time to lose; the first bell was already ringing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am going on to Schandau,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;If you
like, I will send you back to your hotel in a droschkey;
and when I get to Schandau, I will hunt up
your father and tell him the mistake he has made.
Here is my card.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looked at it, and her manner at once
changed. A half-repressed smile glimmered on her
face. I felt that we were on a right footing at last,
though I could not at the time understand how it had
happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will confess to you, Mr. Gainsborough,&rsquo; she
said, glancing up at me with a charming trustfulness
in her manner. &lsquo;My papa is so forgetful. We were
not coming back to Dresden. After Schandau we
were going on to Prague; and he has gone off with
all our luggage, and&mdash;and he has left me without even
any money to buy my ticket! At least, I did have
enough, but I spent it all in my shopping.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This cleared up matters at once. &lsquo;How stupid of
me not to have seen it all before!&rsquo; I exclaimed.
&lsquo;Now, we have just time to get the train,&rsquo; I hurried
her on with me as I spoke, bought our tickets in the
twinkling of an eye, and without waiting for the
change, convoyed her rapidly across the platform, and,
with the assistance of a guard, we found ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
safely ensconced in a first-class carriage just as the
train moved off. My beautiful companion, breathless,
smiling, and yet seemingly a little frightened, sank
back on the cushions, and felt for the fan at her girdle.
I wished to give her plenty of time to recover her
composure, and to feel assured that I had no intention
of taking undue advantage of our position; so, having
arranged the windows to suit her convenience, I
betook myself to the other end of the carriage, and
diligently stared at the prospect for fully five minutes.
Nature could endure no more, and at the end of that
time I was fain to change my posture. I stole a
glance at my fair American. She, too, was absorbed
in the prospect on her side, which consisted at the
moment of a perpendicular cutting about ten feet
distant from her window. Her attitude as she sat
there was the perfection of feminine grace. Her left
hand, loosely holding the fan, drooped on her lap;
her sleeve, slightly pushed up, revealed the lovely
curve of her arm and wrist. I am a particular
admirer of beautiful wrists and hands, and here I saw
my ideal. How exquisitely the glove fitted! and
how artistically the colour harmonised with the rest
of her costume! The other little hand supported her
chin: I could just see the rounded outline of her
small cheek, and the movement of the dark eyelash
projecting beyond it. Beneath her hat the black hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
turned in a careless coil, and charming little downy
curls nestled in the nape of her neck. She was a
thorough brunette, pale, and yet pervaded with warm
colour. Beneath the skirt of her crisp dress peeped
the pointed toe of an ineffable little boot, which occasionally
lifted itself and tapped the floor softly. Suddenly,
in the midst of my admiring inspection, she
turned round upon me, and our eyes met. There was
an instant&rsquo;s constraint, and then we both laughed, and
the constraint passed away, not to return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was going to ask you,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;whether you
wouldn&rsquo;t prefer sitting on this side. You will find the
river better worth looking at than that stone wall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am under your orders, sir, for the present;
you put me here; and now, if you tell me I am to go
elsewhere, I shall obey.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She rose as she spoke; the jolting of the carriage
caused her to lose her balance; I held out my hand
to assist her, and so she tottered across and seated
herself opposite me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now are you satisfied?&rsquo; she asked demurely,
folding her hands in her lap, and sending a flash into
me from those mystical eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, indeed, if you are. Did you ever travel
this way before?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you mean, alone with a gentleman I never
met before&mdash;no!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, what I meant was&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know&mdash;I was only making fun. Yes, I believe
I was in this part of the country once, when I was a
very little girl; that was before I went to the Convent,
you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To the Convent?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She gave a charming impromptu laugh. &lsquo;I
wasn&rsquo;t quite a nun&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to make you believe
that! Only I was brought up in a convent near
Paris; educated there, as many young ladies are. I
was there seven years&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t that long? and I only
got out a little while ago.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It must have been awfully dull.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I liked it in a sort of way; they were very
kind to me there; but then I didn&rsquo;t know how pleasant
it was outside! You would never believe how
delightful the world is, if you were only told about
it. My papa used to tell me about it sometimes;
and he is a great traveller&mdash;he has been everywhere.
But I didn&rsquo;t realise it until I saw for myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you been to America since leaving the
Convent?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh yes. I went to New York, and saw my
cousins there. Papa went with me, but he came back
to Paris first, and I followed later. I met him again
in Paris only a week ago. He will be surprised to see
you here, Mr. Gainsborough. What a funny way you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
have chosen to go from Paris to Rome&mdash;through
Dresden!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I&mdash;but, by-the-bye, how did you know I
was going to Rome? and why will your papa be
surprised&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again she laughed, and regarded me with so
delightfully mischievous a glance that I felt convinced
I must in some way be making a fool of myself.
What did it all mean? I bit my lip, and the colour
came into my face from provocation at my own
evident thick-headedness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you had only waited a little longer in Paris,&rsquo;
she continued, still smiling enigmatically, &lsquo;perhaps
we might have met in a more regular way, and
perhaps, then, you would have let me have had a look
at your&mdash;diamonds!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My diamonds! That explained the mystery in
a flash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is your father Mr. Birchmore?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am Miss Birchmore, if you please, sir. You
never asked me for my card, and I didn&rsquo;t like to force
it on you. It was so kind of you to take me on trust,
without making sure that I was all right first. I
thought Englishmen were more cautious and reserved.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could now join in the laugh against myself with
full appreciation of the excellence of the jest. Mr.
Birchmore, then, had been a married man after all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Of course he was; why had I not before remarked
the strong family likeness between him and his
daughter? Take her on trust, forsooth! How I
longed to retort that I was ready to take her for
better for worse, then and there, if she would have
me. If she were a fair specimen of American girls,
what a nation of houris they must be, indeed! But,
then, they were not all brought up in French convents.
It was that that added to Miss Birchmore the last
irresistible charm. That it was that gave her that
naÃ¯vetÃ©, that innocent frankness, that unconscious
freedom. And this lovely creature had actually
known me, by report, before we met. Her father had
told her of me, and evidently he had not given me a
bad character. And this accounted for the favourable
change in her manner when she saw my card. Well,
it was altogether delightful; I had been guided by a
happy destiny; thank fortune I had so conducted
myself as at least not to prejudice Miss Birchmore
against me. Verily, good manners are never thrown
away; and, moreover, I prided myself (as I fancy
most gentlemen do) on my ability to detect a true
lady at a glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We now resumed our conversation on a still more
confidential footing than heretofore. Miss Birchmore
related many amusing anecdotes of her late experience
in New York, as well as of her earlier days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
in the Convent, and even some passages of her child-life
previous to the latter epoch. I observed, however,
that ever and anon she would check herself, seeming
to pass over certain passages in her history in silence;
and this reminded me of the similar behaviour which
I had noted in her father. That secret&mdash;that mystery,
whatever it was, that weighed upon him&mdash;had cast its
shadow over her young heart likewise. Honestly did
I sympathise with her unknown trouble, and ardently
did I long&mdash;all vulgar curiosity aside&mdash;to have the
knowledge of it imparted to me. Few calamities are
so heavy as that, by earnest and friendly help, they
may not be lightened. What could it be? In vain I
asked myself that question. Here was this lovely
girl, in the first fresh bloom of existence, just
beginning to taste, with eager uncloyed palate, all the
sweet joys and novelties of life&mdash;health, youth, a
happy temperament, and ample wealth ranked on her
side; and yet this bitterness of a misfortune, not
by rights her own, must needs communicate its
blighting influence to her! It was tragical to
think of. Yes, ever and anon I could mark its traces
in her vivid face and winning bearing. A passing
gloom of sadness in those wonderful eyes; a quiver
of apprehension about the lips; an involuntary
gesture of nervousness or lassitude; many trifling
signs, scarcely perceptible, perhaps, to a regard less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
keen and watchful than mine had already become.
Already?&mdash;but time in an acquaintance like this is
not to be measured by hours or minutes. It is a trite
saying, and yet how true, that those who are under
the influence of a strong emotion may live years in a
few heart-beats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Please&mdash;oh, please don&rsquo;t look so solemn, Mr.
Gainsborough! What has happened? I should
think, to look at you, that you had been robbed of
your diamonds at the very least?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No; they are safe enough,&rsquo; said I, calling up as
cheerful a tone and aspect as I could muster, and
putting my hand over the inner pocket as I spoke.
&lsquo;Are you fond of diamonds?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, did you ever hear of a girl who wasn&rsquo;t? I
think there is nothing so beautiful. Papa has a great
many, but he says I mustn&rsquo;t wear them until after
I am married. Isn&rsquo;t that hard?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But perhaps you think of being married before
long?&rsquo; I inquired, with positively a jealous throb at
my heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No; that&rsquo;s the trouble; I know I shall never be
married.&rsquo; These words were uttered in a lower and
graver tone, and once more I thought I could discern
the flitting traces of that mysterious melancholy. But
she brightened up when I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, he won&rsquo;t object to your seeing my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
diamonds, at any rate; not even to your putting
them on, perhaps!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just for a minute&mdash;may I? that will be splendid!
Papa says that some of them are the finest he
ever saw.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For longer than a minute, Miss Birchmore, if
you are willing&mdash;I mean if he&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; What did I
mean, pray? Was I going to make an offer of my
hand, heart, and diamonds, on less than an hour&rsquo;s
acquaintance, in a railway carriage? and was I going
to forget that the diamonds did not belong to me
at all, but to my respected mother, who would
probably see me cut off with a shilling before granting
me the disposal of them? Luckily for my self-possession
and self-respect, the train drew up just
then at the station known as Krippen, on the bank
of the river immediately opposite Schandau. The
guard opened the door; we alighted, and the first
person we saw was Mr. Birchmore, and close behind
him a short, ungainly, beetle-browed fellow, a valet
or footman apparently, with a campstool, an umbrella,
and a small basket of fruit on his arm.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Birchmore shook my hand cordially, yet I
fancied that he betrayed signs of embarrassment or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
uneasiness. He seemed glad to meet me on my own
account, and yet to feel constrained by my presence.
Had he any reason for wishing to conceal from me
the fact that he had a daughter? It now occurred to
me for the first time that in her conversation with me
Miss Birchmore had never alluded to her mother.
Perhaps her mother was dead&mdash;had died in her
child&rsquo;s infancy. Perhaps the silence concerning her
arose from some other and less avowable cause;
there might be some matrimonial disgrace or tragedy
at the bottom of the father and daughter&rsquo;s reserve.
The idea had a certain plausibility, and yet I found it
unsatisfactory. The true explanation of the mystery
might not be worse than this, but I fancied it must
be different&mdash;it must be something more unusual and
strange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is an unexpected pleasure,&rsquo; said I, for the
sake of saying something, as we descended the steps
down the river embankment to the ferry-boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The world is not so large a place as people pretend,&rsquo;
replied Mr. Birchmore. &lsquo;Have you been long
in Dresden?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A week or so. I&rsquo;ve been doing the neighbourhood,
and was told that Saxon Switzerland must not
be left out of the list. I came near going by the
boat&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Here I suddenly recollected that if
Mr. Birchmore had gone by boat, as his daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
said he had, his presence in Schandau before us was
wholly inexplicable. &lsquo;How did you manage to get
here so quickly?&rsquo; I exclaimed; &lsquo;the steamer can&rsquo;t be
due for three hours yet!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked at me in apparent perplexity;
Miss Birchmore seemed to share my own surprise.
There was a pause of a few moments; then she
said in a low tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You know, papa, I got word that, from some
misunderstanding, you had taken the steamer instead
of the train.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, to be sure,&rsquo; he rejoined, with a short
laugh; &lsquo;I see the difficulty. You must look upon
me, I suppose, as a sort of magician, able to
transport myself about the country on some new
telegraphic principle. Well, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t lay
claim to any such supernatural power. I shall lose
credit by the explanation, but you shall have it
nevertheless.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no! give us room for the exercise of our
imagination,&rsquo; cried I, laughing. The fact was, I felt as
if my query had been in some way unfortunate.
There was a certain effort in Mr. Birchmore&rsquo;s manner,
and a want of spontaneity in his laugh. In my ignorance
of the true lay of the land, I was continually
making some irritating blunder; and the more I tried
to make myself agreeable, the worse was my success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Birchmore, notwithstanding that I deprecated
it, chose to make his explanation. &lsquo;Kate was right,&rsquo;
said he; &lsquo;my first intention was to go by train.
Afterwards I decided on the boat, and left the hotel
with the purpose of getting our passage that way,
and sending Kate word to meet me at the landing.
But the boat turned out to be so crowded that I
changed my mind again: it was then so late that
I hadn&rsquo;t time to reach the central railway station;
my only chance of catching the train was to jump
into a droschkey at the steamboat landing and drive
as the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kutcher</i> never drove before, for the lower
station, which was half-a-mile nearer. I got there
barely in time; and Kate, it seems, was waiting
at the central all the while!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And of course,&rsquo; added Miss Birchmore, &lsquo;the
people at the hotel fancied he <em>had</em> gone by the
boat, and sent me word so. Oh yes, I understand it
all now; don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Gainsborough?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t take it kindly of your father to strip away
the illusions from life so pitilessly,&rsquo; returned I, in
a humorous tone; &lsquo;I should have been much happier
in believing that he had flown through the air on
the Arabian king&rsquo;s wishing-carpet.&rsquo; This sally sufficed
to raise the smile of which we all seemed so greatly in
want, and so we got into the ferry-boat in a comparatively
easy frame of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The valet to whom I have already alluded sat
on a thwart near the bows, in such a position that
I had a full view of him. A more unconciliating
object I have seldom beheld. His body and arms
were long, but his legs were short, and bowed outwards.
His features were harsh, forbidding, and
strongly marked; but there was an expression of
power stamped upon them which fascinated my gaze
in spite of the ugliness which would otherwise have
made me glad to look away. It was not the power
of intellect, for although there was plenty of a
saturnine kind of intelligence in the countenance,
it was not to be supposed that a fellow in his position
of life would be remarkable for brains. No, this
power was of another kind; I do not know how
to describe it; but I believe some people would get
out of the difficulty by calling it magnetic. Whatever
it was, it produced a very disagreeable impression on
me, and I could not but wonder that Mr. Birchmore
should have chosen to take such a creature into his
employ. I had the sense, however, on this occasion
to keep my speculations to myself; I was resolved
not to make a fool of myself again if I could help it&mdash;at
least, not with this particular family. I noticed
that whenever Mr. Birchmore had occasion to address
this man, he did so in a peculiarly severe and
peremptory tone, very different from his usual low-voiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
style. There was seemingly no great affection
for him on his master&rsquo;s part, therefore; and certainly
the valet looked incapable of a tender feeling towards
any human creature. Possibly, however, he was
invaluable as a servant, and his unpropitiating exterior
might cover an honest and faithful heart. Only
should such turn out to be the case, I would never
again put faith either in physiognomy or my own
instinct of aversion. I disliked to think of this ill-favoured
mortal being in daily association with my
lovely Kate Birchmore&mdash;for already, in my secret
soul, I called her mine! and I made up my mind
that if ever fortune granted me the privilege of
making her what I called her, I would see to it that
monsieur the valet formed a part of anyone&rsquo;s household
rather than ours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the ferryman had poled and paddled
us across the river, on the shore of which a swarm of
hotel-porters stood ready to rend us limb from limb.
But Mr. Birchmore put them all aside save one, to
whom he pointed out my trunk, and gave him some
directions which I did not hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I take the liberty,&rsquo; he then said, turning to me,
&lsquo;to so far do the honours of this place as to recommend
you to the most agreeable hotel in it&mdash;the
Badehaus, at the farther end of the village, and about
half a mile up the valley. These hotels that front the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
river would give you better fare, perhaps, and less
unpretending accommodation; but if quiet and
coolness are what you are after&mdash;not to mention the
medicinal spring water and a private brass band&mdash;the
Badehaus is the thing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Badehaus be it, by all means.&rsquo; This attention
surprised me, not because I misdoubted my
friend&rsquo;s courtesy, but because I had imagined that his
courtesy would not stand in the way of an unobtrusive
attempt to withdraw himself and his daughter from
my immediate companionship. Yet so far was this
from being the case, that he had taken some pains to
secure our being together&mdash;for of course the Badehaus
must be his own quarters. I glanced at Kate, who had
taken her father&rsquo;s arm, and was pacing beside him
thoughtfully, with downcast eyes. Was she glad as
well as I?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We passed through a narrow alley between two
friendly buildings, which seemed strongly inclined to
lean on one another&rsquo;s shoulders; crossed the rough
cobble-stones of the little market-place, and, gaining
the farther side of the bridge, found ourselves on a
broad level walk which skirted the southern side of
the small valley wherein the village lies. On our
right hand was a series of stuccoed villas, built against
the steep side of the hill; on our left a strip of meadow,
with a brook brawling through it; and beyond this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
again the straggling array of the village, and the hill
on the other side. Overhead, the spreading branches
of low trees kept off the glare of the sun. Had Kate
and I been there alone, methought, the charm of the
place would have been complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What delightful little villas these are!&rsquo; I exclaimed.
&lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t they better than any hotel&mdash;even
the Badehaus?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you think of spending any great time here&mdash;I
believe they don&rsquo;t let for less than a week. But
probably these are all full at this season. Higher up
the valley, two or three miles beyond the hotel, you
would find detached farmhouses, whose owners no
doubt would be glad of a lodger. If you are not
broken in to a traveller&rsquo;s hardships, though, you&rsquo;ll
prefer the Badehaus.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think I shall prefer it as long as you are
there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry to say that won&rsquo;t be long&mdash;we
shall move to-morrow morning. If I had expected
you, I&mdash;I should have been happy to have arranged
matters otherwise. But the fact is, I have engaged
rooms at one of the farmhouses I spoke of, and
to-morrow they will expect us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My spirits fell at this news like a feather in a
vacuum, and I daresay my face showed it. There
could be no doubt now that Mr. Birchmore was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
resolved to get rid of me. That he would go to-morrow
to some distant farmhouse I did not question; but as
to his having intended any such thing before he saw
me alight from the train, I confess I didn&rsquo;t believe it.
It was an unpremeditated expedient; and his inviting
me up to the Badehaus was only a polite mitigation
of the shock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am very sorry!&rsquo; was all I could say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate turned her face a little towards me at the
words, and her eyes met mine sidelong. Only that
look&mdash;she did not speak; but I saw, or thought I
saw, enough in it to make our parting at such brief
notice a sentimental impossibility. At whatever
sacrifice of the laws of ceremony and civilised reserve,
I determined that my acquaintance with her,
so well begun, should not thus be nipped in the
bud. I would sooner win her as a barbarian than
lose her as a man of the world. How to execute
my determination was a problem to be solved at my
leisure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sauntered on to the hotel, chatting discursively;
my mind was too much preoccupied to
be thoroughly aware what we were talking about.
Arrived at our destination, I followed my trunk to
my room, having arranged to take an early dinner
with my friends. It was nearly two hours before we
met again. The dinner passed with the same sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of desultory conversation that we had affected during
our walk. Mr. Birchmore&rsquo;s manner was serious and
rather cold. Kate, too, was subdued and grave; not
the brilliant laughing Kate of the railway carriage.
We were waited upon at table by the saturnine valet
whom his master called Slurk&mdash;a name that seemed
to me to suit him excellently well. He waited on
us in perfect silence from the beginning of the
meal to the end, though several times peremptorily
addressed by his master. There was to me something
disagreeably impressive in the fellow&rsquo;s very
taciturnity&mdash;it seemed to indicate reserved power.
Kate, I noticed, was careful never to speak to him,
but I saw his glance several times directed fixedly
upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After dinner Mr. Birchmore produced a cigar
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must take a droschkey over to our farmhouse.
Do you young people care to come, or would you
rather stay here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll stay, papa, please,&rsquo; answered Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I, to see that nobody runs away with her,&rsquo;
I added with an easy smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Slurk, get me a carriage,&rsquo; said Mr. Birchmore;
and nodding a good-bye to us he went out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How far is it from here&mdash;this farmhouse, Miss
Birchmore?&rsquo; I asked, when we were alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe about two miles.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should like to know its exact situation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go with papa, then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you imagine?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had been absently puckering her handkerchief
into folds in her lap. Now she looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why do you wish to know where we are
going?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because I&rsquo;ve taken a great fancy to&mdash;to
Mr. Slurk, and I can&rsquo;t bear to think of losing sight of
him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had expected her to laugh and perhaps blush;
instead of that an expression of something like terror
swept over her face, and she laid her finger on her
lip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of him!&rsquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her emotion had so surprised me that I could
only stare in silence. Here was another mystery&mdash;or
stay! could it be that Slurk was at the bottom of all
those strange signs and enigmas that I had been
puzzling myself over from the first? I was prepared
to believe whatever amount of evil concerning the
fellow might be required. But what could he have
done, or have it in his power to do, that could so
affect Miss Birchmore? Had he held her life or
fortune at the mercy of a word she could hardly have
betrayed more dismay at my jesting satire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rsquo; she said, recovering herself after a
moment. &lsquo;Only I don&rsquo;t like him much, and you&mdash;and
I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to hear his name just
then.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Heaven knows, it is a very different name I
should have spoken!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no, no. You have amused yourself with me
to-day; and to-morrow, you must find someone else
to amuse you, that&rsquo;s all!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Amused myself, Miss Birchmore!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Mr. Gainsborough, I&rsquo;m sorry if I failed
to entertain you. I&rsquo;m sure I tried hard. But it&rsquo;s so
difficult to entertain an Englishman!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Upon my word, I believe you&rsquo;ve been laughing
at me from the beginning! But however ridiculous I
may be, Miss Birchmore, I can have thoughts and
feelings that are not ridiculous&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, please&mdash;please don&rsquo;t be angry. And I&rsquo;m
sure I never thought you ridiculous, I&mdash;oh, anything
but that!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tone, the look which accompanied these last
words made me forget caution and self-possession for
the moment. &lsquo;Miss Birchmore&mdash;oh Kate! I cannot
lose sight of you&mdash;I cannot lose you! Do you care&mdash;is
it nothing to you if we never meet after to-day?
Kate, I love you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had the confession come too soon? Was she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
offended? She shrank away from me with a
searching glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do not forget yourself, sir! You are an
honourable English gentleman. What have you
said?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I love you&mdash;yes, love you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Love me!&rsquo; she repeated slowly, and caught her
breath; her eyes fixed themselves on me with an
inward look, as of intense reverie. &lsquo;It must not be&mdash;it
must not be! but he does love me!&rsquo; Her hands
fell in her lap; there were tears now in her eyes, but
a smile quivered over her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why do you say it must not be, Kate? It is!
It shall be!&rsquo; I took her hand, which she scarcely
attempted to withdraw; I felt that I had won her,
and would hold her against all comers. Just then
a knock came at the door; she snatched her hand
away and rose to her feet. Mr. Slurk entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The band is going to play in the court,&rsquo; he said
in German. &lsquo;I have kept chairs and a table for the
lady and gentleman beneath the trees.&rsquo; He made a
low obeisance as he spoke, but his malignant glance
never swerved from Kate; and she, half turning
towards him, seemed impelled by a power stronger than
her own will to meet it, though slightly shivering the
while with pure aversion. For my own part, I longed
with all my heart to kick the varlet into the hall, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
throw him out of the window. But prudence warned
me to bide my time. If I obtained the footing to
which I aspired in Mr. Birchmore&rsquo;s family, I would
settle summarily with Mr. Slurk; meanwhile, I
should best consult my interests by conducting
myself with all due quietness and decorum. I offered
Kate my arm to lead her from the room; but with a
barely perceptible gesture she declined it, and walked
swiftly before me through the doorway, Slurk making
another deep obeisance as we passed. The fellow
had a smooth unimpeachable way of getting the
better of one that made my blood boil; I commanded
myself not without an effort, and nursed my wrath
to keep it warm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we reached the court, the brass band had
established itself in the little pagoda erected there for
its accommodation, and was just striking up; and
there, sure enough, were a table and chairs awaiting
us beneath the trees. But neither of us was in a
humour to face a crowd of people; and by a tacit
agreement we turned to the right, and crossing the
little plank bridge which spanned the narrow stream
that skirted the hotel grounds, we found ourselves in
the high-road leading up the valley. Along this we
walked for some distance, both of us silent; at length
the opening of a path presented itself, which climbed
by a zigzag route to the summit of the pine-clad hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Into this we turned, and in a few moments were out
of sight of alien eyes amidst the thick-growing
hemlocks. The ascent was steep, and at the first
turning in the path my beautiful companion paused
for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you take my arm now, Kate?&rsquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a faint smile she complied. &lsquo;Just for this
once,&rsquo; I heard her murmur, seemingly speaking to
herself. &lsquo;Never again&mdash;but this once I will!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, Kate,&rsquo; I said resolutely, bending forward
so as to catch her eye, &lsquo;let us have done with
mysteries. No more &ldquo;never-agains&rdquo; and &ldquo;just-this-onces,&rdquo;
if you please! First, I want you tell me
whether you love me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She drew her breath hard. &lsquo;I can tell you
nothing, Mr. Gainsborough&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You shall not call me &ldquo;Mr. Gainsborough.&rdquo; If
you can&rsquo;t call me &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; call me nothing; but I will
never be &ldquo;Mr. Gainsborough&rdquo; to you again!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought we were to have no more &ldquo;never-agains?&rdquo;&rsquo;
she rejoined, with a passing sparkle of the
former playfulness in her air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;None of yours, I meant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will call you &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; if you please, on one
condition.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What condition?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That you let it be &ldquo;just this once!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kate, do you love me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, you are cruel!&rsquo; she cried, with passionate
emphasis, slipping her hand from my arm and facing
me with glowing looks. &lsquo;I wish I could say I hate
you! You are a man of the world, and I a poor girl
from a convent, who know nothing. I am trying to
do right, and you oppose me&mdash;you make it hard and
bitter to me. If you loved me as I&mdash;as I would love
if I were a man, you would not press me so. I tell you,
it must not be!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is, shall be, Kate! Dear Kate, we love
each other; and who in the world shall prevent it, or
forbid our being married?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hush! hush!&rsquo; She came a step nearer to me,
and caught my sleeve with her little hand, as a
timorous child might do; glancing nervously over her
shoulder as if something fearful were hidden amongst
the trees. &lsquo;Did you hear nothing?&rsquo; she whispered.
&lsquo;Did not someone call me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only I have called you, dear. I called you
&ldquo;Kate;&rdquo; and I want to call you &ldquo;wife!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She continued to stand motionless, with that
frightened listening expression still on her face; and
yet my words had apparently passed unheard. What
was it, then, that her ears were strained to catch?
To my sense, the forest was full of shadowy
stillness, tempered only by a faint whispering of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
leaves, and now and then a bird-note high overhead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gradually the strange preoccupation left her.
Her breathing, which had been irregular and laboured,
now came evenly and gently once more. She glanced
sidelong at me for a moment; then, with a swift
tender movement she came yet a trifle closer, and laid
her other hand upon my arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tom&mdash;Tom dear! I will say it, for we shall
be parted soon, and then, if I am alive, I shall be
comforted a little to think that I did say it! Listen&mdash;Tom
dear, I love you! Never forget that I said it&mdash;Tom,
I love you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was taken deliciously by surprise. You must
not expect me to tell how I felt or what I said. I can
only remember that I took her in my arms and kissed
her. The bird that warbled over our heads seemed to
utter the ecstasy that I felt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently we began to move on again. I don&rsquo;t
know why I didn&rsquo;t speak; perhaps I thought that our
kiss had been the seal of her surrender, and that therefore
words were for the moment impertinent; by-and-by
the converse would be renewed from a fresh basis.
Besides, my thoughts were flying too fast, just then,
for speech to overtake them. I was thinking how
singular had been the manner and progress of our
acquaintance. It was scarcely in accordance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
what I believed to be my normal temperament and
disposition to plunge so abruptly and almost recklessly
into a new order and responsibility of life. I
had fancied myself too cautious, too cool-headed, for
such an impulsive act. But it was done, and the fact
that Kate&rsquo;s feelings had responded to my own seemed
to justify the apparent risk. We were meant for each
other, and had come together in sheer despite of all
combinations of circumstances to keep us apart.
Knowing, as we did, scarcely anything of each other
as worldly knowledge goes, we had yet felt that
inward instinct and obligation to union which made
the most thorough worldly knowledge look like folly.
What would my mother say to it? How would the
news be relished by her father? I cared not; I foresaw
difficulties enough in store, but none that appalled
me. After all, an honourable man and woman,
honestly in love with each other, are a match against
the world, or superior to it. Union is strength, and
the union of loving hearts is the strongest strength
of all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And do you want to marry me really, Tom?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had gained the summit of the steep hill,
and were now pacing along the ridge. The narrow
winding valley lay sheer beneath us on the right, with
the white road and the dark stream lying side by side
at the bottom of it. The crest of the opposing hillside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
seemed but a short stone&rsquo;s-throw distant; the
aroma of our privacy was the sweeter for the pigmy
droschkey, with its mannikin inmate, which was
crawling along through the dust so far below. We
commanded the world, while we were ourselves
hidden from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should rather think I did, Kate!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought Englishmen only married as a matter
of business; that they married settlements and
dowries and rank and influence, and added women
merely as a matter of custom and politeness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am satisfied to marry for love; if that&rsquo;s un-English,
so much the better for me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You would take me without anything but just
myself?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is worth having, compared with
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh Tom! But then, you cannot have just
myself alone. Nobody in the world is independent
of everything&mdash;not even an American&mdash;not even an
American girl who has lived seven years in a convent!
I may not be able to bring you anything good&mdash;anything
that would make me more acceptable; but what if
I were to bring you something bad&mdash;something terrible&mdash;something
that would make you shudder at me if I
were ten times as lovable as you say I am?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why then, I should have to love you twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
times more than ever I suppose, that&rsquo;s all!&rsquo; I answered,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean what you say&mdash;at least you
don&rsquo;t know what you say. You are not so brave
as you think you are, sir! What do you know
of me?&rsquo; She spoke these sentences in a lower,
graver tone than the previous ones, which had been
uttered in a vein of half-wayward, fanciful playfulness.
Almost immediately, however, she roused herself
again, as though unwilling to let the lightsome
humour escape so soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, let us pretend that you have married me,
for better or worse, and that it is all settled. Now,
where will you take me to first?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where do you wish to go?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, it must be somewhere where nobody could
come after us,&rsquo; she exclaimed, with a curious subdued
laugh. &lsquo;Nobody that either of us has ever known;
neither your mother, nor my father, nor&mdash;nor anybody!
And there we must stay always; because
as soon as we came out, we should lose each other,
and never find each other again. And that would be
sadder than never to have met, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, my darling Kate,&rsquo; interposed I, laughing
again, &lsquo;where on earth, in this age of railways and
steamboats and telegraphs and balloons, are we to
find such a very retired spot? Unless we took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
voyage to the moon, or could find our way down
to the centre of the earth, we should hardly feel safe,
I fear!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, well, you must arrange about that; only it
is as I tell you; and you see marrying me is not such
a simple matter after all. Well, now, suppose we
have reached the place, wherever it is&mdash;what would
you give me for a wedding present?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What would you like?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No&mdash;you are to decide that. It wouldn&rsquo;t be
proper for your wife to choose her own wedding
present, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe such a thing does sometimes happen
though, when the people are very fashionable and
aristocratic.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I am not aristocratic; I am an American.
Now, what will you give me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you say to the diamonds?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I think I will take the diamonds,&rsquo; she
said meditatively, as though weighing the question
in her mind. &lsquo;Yes, papa said I might wear diamonds
after I was married. But might not your
mother object?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not when she knows whom they are for; and, at
any rate, she is going to leave them to me in her will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! and you expect that the news of our marriage
will kill her?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It ought rather to give her a new lease of life.
But you shall have the diamonds all the same. Will
you try them on now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, have you got them with you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly: I always carry them in this pocket.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How careless! You might lose them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No: the pocket buttons up; see!&rsquo; and turning
back the flap of my coat, I showed her how all was
made secure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But what if robbers were to attack you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I should talk to them with this,&rsquo; I rejoined,
taking my revolver from another pocket, and holding
it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a derringer! they have those in
America. What a pretty one! Let me look at it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, replacing it in my pocket; &lsquo;it has
a hair-trigger, and every barrel is loaded. You shall
look at something much prettier, and not dangerous
at all. Here&mdash;sit down on this stump, and take
off your hat, and I&rsquo;ll put them on for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stump of which I spoke stood at the end
of the path we had been following, and within a
few rods of the brink of a precipitous gorge, which
entered the side of the steep mountain-spur nearly
at right angles. Across this gorge (which, though
seventy to one hundred feet in depth, was scarcely
more than half as wide at the top) a wooden bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
had formerly been thrown; but age or accident had
broken it down, until only a single horizontal beam
remained, spanning the chasm from side to side,
and supported by three or four upright and transverse
braces. The beam itself was scarcely nine
inches in width; and the whole structure was a
dizzy thing to look at. My nerves were trained to
steadiness by a good deal of gymnastic experience;
but it would have needed a strong inducement to
get me across that beam on foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate sat down on the stump as I directed;
but her manner had become languid and indifferent;
the brightness and sparkle of her late mood were
gone. As she looked up at me, her level eyebrows
were slightly contracted, and the corners of her
mouth drooped. Her hands were folded listlessly
in her lap. She was dressed in some soft white
material, through which was visible the warm gleam
of her arms and shoulders; the skirt was caught
up in such a way as to allow freedom in walking;
she wore a broad-brimmed white hat over her black
hair; a yellow sash confined her waist, and her
hands were bare. I untied the ribbons of her hat,
she permitting me to do so without resistance; and
then, kneeling before her, I unbuttoned the diamonds
from my pocket, and laid them, in their case, upon
her lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, dear, shall I put them on you, or will you
do it yourself?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She opened the case, and the gems flashed in the
checkered sunshine that filtered down between the
leaves of the trees. The sight seemed to rouse her
somewhat; a faint spot of colour showed in either
cheek, and she drew in a long breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are splendid!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I never saw
anything like them. No, your mother would need
to die before giving up these.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They won&rsquo;t look their best until you have put
them on. Come!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid! what if&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Afraid of what?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What if someone were to come and see&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense, my darling! There&rsquo;s no one within
half a mile of us; and if there were, they would
only see a lovely girl looking her loveliest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How nicely you talk to me! Well then&mdash;you
put them on me. I won&rsquo;t touch them myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The parure consisted of a necklace and a pair
of earrings. I lifted them, flashing, from the case;
clasped the necklace round her throat, she sitting
motionless, and hung the earrings in her ears. A
light, that matched their marvellous gleam, seemed
to enter into her eyes as I did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You and these diamonds were made for each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
other!&rsquo; I said; and bending forwards, I kissed her
on the lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For more than a minute she sat there quite still,
I kneeling in front of her; we were looking straight
into one another&rsquo;s eyes. Then, all at once, a troubled
anxious look came into her face. She rose with a
startled gesture to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hush! hush! did you hear?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; cried I, jumping up in
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hush! someone calling&mdash;calling me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again that strange fancy! What did it mean?
I could not repress a certain thrill at the heart as I
gazed at her. It was very weird and strange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I gazed, a singular change crept over her.
Her face was now quite colourless, and its pallor
was intensified by the blackness of her mystical eyes.
Those eyes slowly grew fixed&mdash;immovable, as if
frozen. The lids trembled for a moment, then
drooped, then lifted again to their widest extent,
and so remained. Her lips, slightly parted, showed
the white teeth set edge to edge behind them. The
rigidity descended through her whole body; she
was like a marble statue. She breathed low and
deeply, as one who is in profound slumber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kate, what has happened to you?&rsquo; I cried in
alarm, putting my hand on her shoulder. Her arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
was fixed like iron; she seemed to hear nothing, feel
nothing. She was as much beyond any power of
mine to influence her as if she had been dead. The
diamonds that glittered on her bosom were not more
insensible than she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must confess that I was somewhat unnerved by
the situation. Kate was evidently in some sort of
trance; but what had put her into that state, and
how was she to be got out of it? For aught I knew,
it might be the prelude to a fit or other seizure of
that nature, involving consequences dangerous if not
fatal. In the bewilderment of the moment the only
remedy that I could think of was cold water; to dash
her with water might be of use, and could scarcely
make matters worse. About thirty paces from where
we were standing a small rill meandered amongst the
roots of the trees, and trickled at last in a tiny cascade
down the rocky side of the gorge. Towards this I
ran, and stooping down, attempted to scoop up some
of the refreshing element in the crown of my straw
hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rising with the dripping hat in my hands, I
turned to go back; but the sight that then met my
eyes caused me to drop everything and spring forward
with a gasp of horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moving as if in obedience to some power
external or at least foreign to herself, as a mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
figure might move, steadily, deliberately, and yet
blindly, Kate had advanced directly towards the
narrow chasm, and when I first beheld her she already
seemed balancing on the brink. Before I could cover
half the distance that separated us, she had set foot
on the long beam which spanned the abyss, and had
begun to walk along it. By the time I reached the
hither end, she was halfway over, stepping as unconsciously
as if she were on an ordinary sidewalk,
though the slightest deflection from a straight
course would have sent her down a hundred feet to
the jagged boulders below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Standing on the hither verge, every nerve so
tensely strung that I seemed to hear the blood humming
through my brain, I watched the passage of
those small feet, which I had admired that morning
as they peeped coquettishly from beneath her dress
in the railway carriage&mdash;I watched them pass, step
after step, along that awful beam. I suppose the
transit must have been accomplished in less than a
minute, but it seemed to me that I was watching it
for hours. I uttered no sound, lest it might rouse her
from her trance and insure the catastrophe that else
she might escape; I did not attempt to overtake her,
fearful lest the beam should fail to support our united
weight. I saw her pass on, rigid, unbending, but sure
of foot as a rope-dancer; and at last I saw her reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the opposite side, and stand once more on solid earth,
preserved from death as it seemed by a miracle. I
have no distinct recollection of how I followed; I
only know that a few seconds afterwards I was
standing beside her, with my arm round her waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I led her forwards a few paces out of sight of the
ravine, the mere thought of which now turned me
sick, and brought her to a plot of soft turf, beneath a
tree with low spreading branches. The trance was
evidently passing away; her limbs no longer had that
unnatural rigidity; her eyelids drooped heavily, and
her jaw relaxed. A violent trembling seized upon
her; she sank down on the turf as if all power of self-support
had gone out of her. At that moment I
fancied I heard a slight crackle among the shrubbery
not far off; I looked quickly up, and saw&mdash;or thought
I saw&mdash;a short ungainly figure obscurely stealing
away through the underbush. Almost immediately
he vanished amidst the trees, leaving me in doubt
whether my eyesight had not after all played me false.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I turned again to Kate, she was sitting up
against the trunk of the tree, the diamonds flashing
at her throat and ears, and a puzzled questioning
expression on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What makes you look so strange?&rsquo; she murmured.
&lsquo;Where is your hat! How did we come
here, Tom? I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She stopped abruptly, and rose slowly to her
feet. Her eyes were cast down shamefacedly, and
she bit her lip. She lifted her hand to her throat, and
felt the diamonds there. Then, with an apprehensive,
almost a cowering glance, she peered stealthily round
through the trees, as though expecting to see something
that she dreaded. Finally she turned again,
appealingly, to me, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I partly understood the significance of
this dumb-show. She was subject to these somnambulistic
trances, and was ashamed of them. She
knew not, on this occasion, what extravagance she
might have committed in the presence of me, her
lover. She feared the construction I might put upon
it, yet was too timid&mdash;or, it might be, too proud&mdash;to
speak. But her misgiving did me injustice. Shocked
and grieved though I was, I loved her more than
ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You were faint, my dear, that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; I said, cheerfully
and affectionately. &lsquo;I brought you under this
tree, and now you&rsquo;re all right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shook her head, with a piteous smile. &lsquo;I
know what has been the matter with me, Mr.
Gainsborough,&rsquo; she said, with an attempt at reserve
and coldness in her tone. &lsquo;I had hoped I might
have parted from you before you knew, but&mdash;it was
not to be so! It is very good of you to pretend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
ignore it, and I thank you&mdash;I thank you. Here,&rsquo; she
added, nervously unclasping the necklace and removing
the earrings, &lsquo;I have worn these too long. Take
them, please.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kate, you shall wear them forever!&rsquo; cried I,
passionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must not begin yet, at all events,&rsquo; she returned
more firmly. &lsquo;Take them, please, or you will make
me feel more humiliated than I do now.&rsquo; She put
them in my unwilling hands. &lsquo;And now we&rsquo;ll get our
hats and go back to the hotel,&rsquo; she continued, with a
smile which was pathetic in its effort to seem indifferent
and unconstrained. &lsquo;Where are they? Ah!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had just caught sight of her white hat lying
beside the stump on the farther side of the gorge.
The suppressed scream and the start indicated that
she now for the first time realised by what a perilous
path she had come hither. She remained for a
moment gazing at the beam with a sort of fascination;
then, moving forward to the brink, looked down the
sheer precipice to the rocks below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wish I had fallen!&rsquo; she said, almost below her
breath; &lsquo;or,&rsquo; she added, after a short pause, in a tone
still lower, but of intense emphasis, &lsquo;I wish he had!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You wish I had?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I did not know you were so near,&rsquo; she answered,
drawing back from the verge. &lsquo;No, no&mdash;not you!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Come, we must walk round this place. Tell me,&rsquo;
she said, facing me suddenly, &lsquo;did you see anyone?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think not. I fancied I heard&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We must get back to the hotel,&rsquo; she interrupted
excitedly; &lsquo;at least, I must get back. I don&rsquo;t like
to be here. I wish you would leave me. I would
rather say good-bye to you here than there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never mean to say good-bye to you at all,
Kate. If this is the trouble you hinted at, you overrate
it entirely. Why, two people out of every seven
are somnambulists. It is as common as to have
black hair. Besides, you will outgrow it in a few
years; it is only a nervous affection, which any doctor
can cure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is not that; you don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; she said,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whatever it is, I&rsquo;m determined not to lose you.
I shall tell your father, when I see him, that I love
you, and that wherever he takes you I shall follow.
No one can or shall keep us apart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The resolution with which I spoke seemed to
impress her somewhat. &lsquo;You can speak to him if
you will. But, oh! it is no use. It cannot be; you
don&rsquo;t understand. Let me go; good-bye. No, do
not come with me; please do not! I have a reason
for asking it. I will see you once more&mdash;to-morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
before we leave. But let me go alone now, if you
love me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She went, walking quickly away through the
wood. I watched her for a few moments, and then
returned to the grass plot beneath the tree, and threw
myself down there in a very dissatisfied frame of
mind. The sun had set before I returned to the
hotel.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I saw nothing more of Kate that day; but I came
across Slurk several times, and there was a peculiar
look on the fellow&rsquo;s countenance which made me
renew my longing to chastise him. I was anxious to
know whether Mr. Birchmore had returned; but, as I
could not bring myself to make any inquiries of his
valet, and did not care to let him see me asking anyone
else, I was obliged to remain in ignorance. However,
as I sat out under the trees at dusk, a tall figure,
with a lighted cigar in his mouth, appeared in the
doorway of the hotel, and, on my saluting him, he
sauntered up to my table, and complied with my
invitation to sit down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The waiter brought us coffee; and under its
stimulus I ventured to introduce the subject which
lay nearest my heart to Mr. Birchmore&rsquo;s notice. No
doubt I put my best foot foremost, and spoke as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
eloquently as was consistent with my downright
earnestness and sincerity. Mr. Birchmore heard me
almost in silence, only giving evidence by an occasional
word or interjection that he was giving me his
attention. Once or twice, too, I was aware of his
having given me one of those sharp icy glances for
which he was remarkable. When I had spoken, he
fingered the pointed beard on his chin meditatively,
and puffed his cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is a very fair and honourable offer that
you make, Gainsborough,&rsquo; he said at length. &lsquo;I liked
you before; I like you better now. You take it for
granted, I suppose, that I&rsquo;m pretty well off. There,
you needn&rsquo;t say anything; I&rsquo;ve no doubt of your disinterestedness;
but these matters would have to be
mentioned, sooner or later, if the affair went on. I
say &ldquo;if,&rdquo; because&mdash;I may as well tell you at once; it
will save us all pain&mdash;because it can&rsquo;t go on: it must
stop right here; and I can only regret, for both your
sakes, that it has gone so far.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Birchmore, I cannot take this for an answer.
You have given me no reasons. If you want confirmation
of my account of myself, I can&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want nothing of the sort; on the contrary, I
feel complimented that you should accept <em>us</em>, not only
without confirmation, but without question. But you
can&rsquo;t marry my daughter, Gainsborough, much as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
like you, and much as I daresay she does. When
you are older, you will understand that men cannot
always follow that course in the world which appears
to them most desirable.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;However young or old I may be, Mr. Birchmore,
I am old enough to know my own mind, and to require
good reasons for changing it. If you have any
such reasons, I wish you&rsquo;d show your liking for me
by telling me what they are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you remember a talk we once had in Paris,
when you hinted that I should accompany you on
your jaunt? I told you then that the past life of a
man sometimes had a hold over his present, constraining
his freedom, whether he would or no. And
can&rsquo;t you imagine that those circumstances, however
cogent they may be, or, very likely, just because they
are so cogent, might be very inconvenient to talk
about? To speak plainly, Gainsborough, I don&rsquo;t
see how your loving my daughter obliges me to tell
you all the secrets of my life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know your secrets, sir; I wish
to marry Miss Birchmore.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Birchmore laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a pretty determined wooer,&rsquo; said
he. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t give my consent to the match, because&mdash;well,
because I cannot; but if you won&rsquo;t take No for
an answer, nor profit by the warning I hereby give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
you, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do. I will allow you
yourself to discover and acknowledge the causes
which make your marriage with Kate impossible.
You must not blame me if the discovery gives you
pain, and the acknowledgment causes you mortification.
I have given you fair warning. And I will
only add, sir, that the pain and mortification won&rsquo;t
be all on your side. I could not give you a stronger
pledge of my friendship and liking for you than in
thus letting you find out what has hitherto been
hidden from all the world. And I only demand one
condition&mdash;that you promise, when you have made
your discovery, and left us, never to mention to any
human being what our secret was.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I give that promise with pleasure. As to my
leaving you of my own free will, that is&mdash;begging
your pardon&mdash;impossible and absurd.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He laughed again, and shot another of his startling
looks at me. &lsquo;Very well, young sir, I&rsquo;ve nothing
more to say. Come with us to the farmhouse to-morrow;
there&rsquo;s plenty of room there, and they are
used to being accommodating. Stay with us until
you&rsquo;re satisfied, and then&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget your promise!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He rose as he finished speaking, and flung away
the remains of his cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-night!&rsquo; he said, holding out his large
well-shaped hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-night! and thanks for your confidence,
which you will never regret, Mr. Birchmore.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Qui vivra, verra!&rsquo; was all his answer, as he
walked away, with his hands in his coat-pockets and
his singular short steps. He was an enigma sure
enough, and yet my belief in him was as intuitive
and inalienable as in Kate herself. His mysterious
hints and warnings were powerless to disturb me: I
trusted in the ability of us three combined to overthrow
any antagonist. I sat late beneath the trees,
smoking, and brooding over my passion, as young
men will, and ever and anon glancing up at a certain
window, behind the lamp-illumined curtain of which
I had reason to suppose my darling was. Was she
thinking of me now? Even as I asked myself this,
and gazed upwards, a shadow fell upon the curtain;
it was pushed aside, and the window was swung back
on its hinges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a throb of the heart I sprang to my feet
and wafted a kiss from my finger-tips towards the
face that peeped out upon me. Stay! was it Kate&rsquo;s
face after all? The arms and shoulders now appeared,
and the form leant upon the window-sill. A lucifer-match
flashed, and I had the pleasure of beholding
the sinister visage of Mr. Slurk lit up by a sulphurous
gleam, as he leisurely lit his pipe and stared down at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;SchÃ¶ne gute Nacht, Herr Gainsborough!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;We made a late start the next morning, and did
not reach the farmhouse before four o&rsquo;clock. I had
little opportunity of speaking to Kate on the way; in
fact, the presence of Slurk, who sat on the box of the
vehicle, and once in a while threw a glance at us over
his shoulder, irritated me to such a degree that more
tender sentiments were temporarily pushed into the
background. Kate herself, though she attempted to
appear cheerful, betrayed signs of inward anxiety and
nervousness; while Mr. Birchmore conversed with a
volubility and discursiveness greater than I had ever
remarked in him before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The farmhouse stood quite alone, on an unfrequented
by-road, in a little angle of the hills. It was
not exactly a picturesque building, with its four walls
covered with rough plaster and pierced with dozens of
small windows, and its enormous red-tiled roof, with
those quaint narrow apertures, like half-opened eyes,
disclosing a single pane of glass, which do duty as
dormers. It stood flush with the road, as German
houses are fond of doing; but behind was a large
enclosed farmyard, roughly paved with round stones
and well walled in. The front door, though rather
pretentiously painted and ornamented, with some
religious versicle or other written up on the lintel, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
not used as a means of entrance or exit. It was, as
I afterwards discovered, not only locked and bolted,
but actually screwed up on the inside; and the only
way of getting into the house was by a side door
opening into the courtyard. As the courtyard itself
was provided with a heavy gate, you will see that
the farmhouse, close to the road though it was,
was by no means so easy of ingress or egress as
it appeared, supposing, of course, that it was the
humour of the inmates to declare a state of siege.
I mention these particulars merely by the way:
they are common to three houses out of five in this
region.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Birchmores&rsquo; luggage had, it appeared, already
been carried over from the hotel; but a man, in rough
peasant&rsquo;s costume, who announced himself as the
master of the house, now came out to take charge of
my trunk. I was, or fancied myself (as you may have
noticed), a quick judge of faces, and this peasant&rsquo;s
face failed to commend itself to me. It was at once
heavy and gloomy, while a scar at one corner of his
mouth caused that feature to twist itself into a perfunctory
grimace, grotesquely at variance with his
normal expression. In person he was much above
the common size, and to judge by the ease with which
he slung my heavy trunk over his shoulder, he must
have been as strong as Augustus the Stark himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
whose brazen statue domineers over the market-place
in Dresden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Guten Morgen, Herr Rudolph!&rsquo; said Slurk, hailing
this giant affably. The two seemed to be on some
sort of terms of comradeship, having, perhaps, struck
up an acquaintance during the previous negotiations
for lodgings. I must say they looked to me to be a
not ill-matched pair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We alighted, and were welcomed in with surly
courtesy by Herr Rudolph. Kate, confessing to a
headache, went at once to her room, whence she did
not again emerge; Slurk disappeared into the kitchen
regions with the landlord; Mr. Birchmore presently
went out for a stroll before dinner: and I, finding
myself thrown temporarily on my own resources,
decided to make a virtue of my loneliness by writing
some letters which had been long owing. I accordingly
groped my way up the darksome stone staircase,
and so along an eccentric passage to my room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know then, nor could I, even now, accurately
describe the arrangement of rooms in that
farmhouse. There were at least three separate
passages, not running at right angles to one another,
but seeming to wander about irregularly, now and
then turning awkward corners, descending or ascending
short flights of steps, or eddying into a little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cul-de-sac</i>,
with, perhaps, only a closet door at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
it. The consequence was, it was nearly impossible to
say whose room adjoined whose. It might be a long
distance from one to another, measured along the
passage, and yet they might actually be separated
only by the thickness of a wall. Where the farmer
and his family slept I know not, but I have reason to
believe that all our party, including Slurk, were
accommodated upon the same floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On opening the door of my room, I found someone
already there. This person was a comely young
woman, the farmer&rsquo;s daughter evidently, busy in the
benevolent occupation of putting things in order. She
had moved my trunk beneath the window, she had
put fresh water in the ewer, she had straightened out
the slips of drugget on the rough-board floor, she had
placed some flowers in the window, and she was now
engaged in tucking a clean sheet on the bed. I said
she was comely; on second looks she was better
than that. She was positively pretty, with the innocent
blonde prettiness of some German peasant-girls.
Her fair hair, smoothed compactly over her small
head, and wound up in a funny little pug behind,
possessed a faint golden lustre; her eyes were of
as pure and serene a blue as any I ever looked upon;
her smooth cheeks, slightly browned by much sunshine
which had rested on them, were tinged with
healthful bloom; her mouth might have been smaller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
but the full lips were well-shaped, and there were
white even teeth behind them. Her figure, like that
of most Saxon peasant-girls of her age, was robust
and vigorous; she wore a simple bodice and skirt,
and her feet and legs were bare. Altogether I
thought her a very agreeable apparition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-morning, honoured Herr Gainsborough,&rsquo;
she said gravely, in German, as I entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-morning, pretty maiden,&rsquo; returned I
gallantly. &lsquo;You seem to know my name, though I
don&rsquo;t know yours: what is it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am called Christina&mdash;Christina Rudolph. It
is some time that I have known Herr Gainsborough&rsquo;s
name,&rsquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Really! how comes that?&rsquo; I asked, by no
means displeased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The honoured Herr has been kind to a relation
of mine&mdash;a very near relation,&rsquo; replied Christina, with
the same gravity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have I? I&rsquo;m glad to hear it! Was she as
pretty as thou?&rsquo; inquired I, venturing upon the
familiar form of address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She blushed, and answered: &lsquo;It was not a woman&mdash;it
was my brother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, thy brother! And where did I meet thy
brother?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In Paris, Herr Gainsborough.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In Paris! Rudolph! What, art thou the sister
of Heinrich Rudolph, who lives in the Latin Quarter,
and is considered the cleverest jeweller in the city?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, honoured Herr,&rsquo; returned Christina, smiling
for the first time, and showing her pretty teeth and
a dimple on either cheek. &lsquo;My brother Heinrich
cut and arranged the diamonds in the parure of the
honoured Herr&rsquo;s mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So he did, Christina, and he did it better than
anyone except him could have done it. And so thou
art really his sister! How did he tell thee of me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He wrote to me while you were still in Paris,
and described the pretty stones, and told how Herr
Gainsborough used to come and sit with him, and
see him work, and talk a great deal with him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, he was well worth talking with! And I
remember now that he said he was born in this
neighbourhood, and that he had a sister and a father
living here. It was stupid of me not to have thought
of that when I heard your name. Well, Christina,
I&rsquo;m afraid I wasn&rsquo;t of much use to him after all.
I tried to get him customers, but I knew very few
people in Paris; and the only person I did succeed
in introducing to him&mdash;by the way! it was this
gentleman who is with me now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Herr Birchmore; yes, my brother spoke also
of him,&rsquo; said Christina, her gravity returning. &lsquo;But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
he did not speak of the young lady, or of the
servant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I believe they weren&rsquo;t with him at the
time. I only met them myself since I came to
Schandau.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The young lady is Herr Birchmore&rsquo;s&mdash;wife?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His wife? Dear heavens, no! His daughter,
of course, Christina.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christina said nothing, being occupied in neatly
smoothing out the pillow, and laying the wadded
counterpane over the sheet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will Herr Gainsborough stay with us long?&rsquo;
she asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As long as Herr Birchmore does, I suppose,&rsquo;
said I carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And Herr Birchmore&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo; subjoined
Christina, with a twinkle of mischief so demure that
I could hardly be sure whether she meant it or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou art as clever as thy brother, Christina,&rsquo;
I laughed, colouring a little too however, I daresay,
&lsquo;It is true I have not known them long, but&mdash;but
people see a good deal of one another in travelling
together.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have heard it said that travelling makes
people acquainted with&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; she paused, and looked
down thoughtfully at her bare feet. Presently she
lifted her blue eyes straight to mine and asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Herr Gainsborough has his diamonds with
him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Undoubtedly! They are never away from me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In going about this place, the Herr should be
cautious. Some of these hills and valleys are very
lonely. There are spots, not far from here, where
no one goes for sometimes many months.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be very careful, Christinchen,&rsquo; I
rejoined laughing, and in truth not a little amused
at the care my friends took of me. &lsquo;But thou must
remember that no one in Germany, except Herr
Birchmore, and his daughter, and thyself, knows that
any such diamonds as these are in existence&mdash;much
less that they are in my pocket!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christina raised her finger to her lips, as if to
caution me to speak lower. &lsquo;There is at least one
other who knows&mdash;the man Slurk!&rsquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, perhaps he may,&rsquo; I replied, somewhat
struck by her observation; &lsquo;and as I see thou hast
taken a dislike to the fellow, I will confide to thee
that I consider him an atrocious brute. But brute
though he is, there&rsquo;s no harm in him of <i>that</i> kind.
He is an old servant of Herr Birchmore, I believe,
and would of course be dismissed at once if there
were anything serious against him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Naturally!&rsquo; was all Christina&rsquo;s answer; she
made no pretence of arguing the point with me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
&lsquo;Adieu, honoured sir!&rsquo; she said at the door. But
with her hand upon the latch she paused, turned
round, and added rather confusedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will Herr Gainsborough go on any expedition
with his friends to-day?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, I hardly think so, Christina.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But to-morrow, perhaps?&rsquo; she persisted, lifting
her blue eyes to mine again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; I admitted, with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then&mdash;if he can trust me&mdash;would the Herr
mind leaving the diamonds with me, until he comes
back again?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, Christinchen, I cannot give them up, even
to thee&mdash;and although I trust thee as much as thy
brother, or myself. But thou mightst lose them&mdash;and
if they are to be lost at all, I would rather the
responsibility should be mine. Besides,&rsquo; I continued,
showing my revolver, &lsquo;I go always with this. But I
thank thee all the same, Christinchen, and I would
like to do something&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stepped towards her: the fact is, I suppose I
meant to kiss her. But her expression changed in
a manner not encouraging to such an advance; she
looked both grave and hurt, and I paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was going to say&mdash;if thou wouldst like to see
the diamonds, it would give me great pleasure to
show them to thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Many thanks, honoured sir! I would rather
not.&rsquo; And with a formal curtsy the fair-haired
little maid opened the door and disappeared, leaving
me feeling rather foolish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The pretty peasant has a pride of her own!&rsquo;
I said to myself, as I opened my trunk and got out
my writing materials. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s actually offended because
I wouldn&rsquo;t constitute her guardian of thirty
thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of diamonds. Good gracious!
why, that father of hers, if I know anything of faces,
would cut all our throats for as many groschen. But
what an unmistakable scamp my friend Slurk must
be to have aroused the suspicions of such an innocent
unsophisticated little creature as Christinchen! By
Jove, though, anybody might be suspicious of a leer
and a slouch like his! What if there should be
anything in it? Just suppose such a thing for a
moment, eh? It&rsquo;s impossible, to be sure; but the
impossible does sometimes happen. How on earth
did Birchmore ever happen to have such a fellow
about him? I tell you I&rsquo;ve always had a notion that
he may be at the bottom of all this mystery that
Birchmore and Kate are so much exercised by. Now,
what if he&mdash;but pshaw!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is one thing I&rsquo;m resolved to do, however,&rsquo;
I continued to myself, as I settled down with paper,
pens, and ink at the table in the window. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
buttonhole Birchmore this very afternoon, and get
out of him everything he knows about his precious
valet. It can do no harm to have the matter cleared
up. The thing is absurd, of course; still, the situation
out here is rather lonely; and with two such
lovely neighbours as Papa Rudolph and Slurk&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">par
nobile fratrum</i>&mdash;it may be as well to be on the safe
side. Yes, that shall be cleared up to-day!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having arrived at this sapient determination, I
set to work writing my letters, and scribbled away
diligently for an hour or two. At length, as I was
looking vacantly up from my paper, at a loss for
something interesting to set down upon it, my eyes
happened to rest upon the pane of my open window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like nearly all German windows, it opened inwards
on hinges, instead of running up and down
in grooves. The pane on my left, therefore, having
the dark room as a background, acted as a mirror of
the sunlit landscape outside on the right, showing me
a portion thereof which was directly invisible to me
from where I sat, and to any person standing in which
I must myself be invisible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now my window was on the southern side of the
house, which fronted westward on the road. On
the opposite side of the road was a narrow strip
of land planted with vegetables, and above this rose
the abrupt side of a hill, ascended by a winding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
path partly hidden by the trees. I could not see this
hill and path without leaning out of the window and
looking towards the right; but a considerable part of
it was reflected in my window-pane mirror, and
could thus be readily observed without rising from
my chair. Happening, then, as I said, to cast my
eyes upon this mirror, I saw two persons standing
together on the path upon the hillside, and conversing
in a very animated manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no difficulty in recognising them: they
were Mr. Birchmore and his valet. So far there was
nothing surprising in the spectacle. That which did
surprise and even astonish me, however, was the
mutual bearing of the two men towards each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have already mentioned the peremptory tone in
which Mr. Birchmore uniformly addressed the man
Slurk, and the generally overbearing attitude he
assumed towards him; but in the conversation now
going forward all this was changed. To judge by
appearances, I should have said that Slurk was the
master, and Mr. Birchmore the valet. The former
was gesticulating forcibly, and evidently laying down
the law in a very decided and autocratic way. His
square ungainly figure seemed to dilate, and take
on a masterful and almost hectoring air; while
Mr. Birchmore stood with his hands in his coat-pockets,
undemonstrative and submissive, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
accepting with meekness all that the other advanced,
and only occasionally interpolating a remark or a
suggestion, to which Slurk would pay but slight or
impatient attention. Both were evidently talking in
a low tone; for though they were not more than fifty
or sixty yards from where I sat, I could not catch a
single word, nor even so much as an inarticulate
murmur, unless by deliberately straining my ears.
But I did not need nor care to hear anything: what
I saw was quite enough to startle and mystify me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a few minutes the two interlocutors moved
slowly on up the path, and were soon beyond the
field of my mirror. But the unexpected scene which
I had witnessed did not so soon pass out of my
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got up from my table and began walking
about the room, with the restlessness of one who
cannot make his new facts tally with his preconceived
ideas. Who and what was Slurk, and how had he
obtained ascendancy over a man like Birchmore?
Certainly it could not be a natural ascendancy.
Birchmore must have put himself in the other&rsquo;s
power. In other words, Slurk must be blackmailing
him. And this was the trouble, was it?&mdash;this was
the mystery? It was an ugly and awkward business,
certainly; but the main question remained after all
unanswered. What was it that Birchmore had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
to give Slurk a hold upon him? and had that act,
whatever it was, compromised his daughter along
with him? For now that I gathered up in my
memory all the hints and signs which had come
under my notice in relation to this affair, I could not
help thinking that Kate&rsquo;s attitude had in it something
suggestive of more than mere filial sympathy with
her father&rsquo;s misfortune. In that misfortune or disgrace
she had a personal and separate in addition to
a sympathetic share. And yet, in what conceivable
way could a low villain like Slurk fasten his gripe
upon a pure and spotless young girl? and what a
hideous thought&mdash;that such a girl should be in any
way at his mercy! The more I turned the matter
over in my mind, the more ugly did it appear. No
wonder that father and daughter had warned me
away. Some men in my position, having seen thus
far, might have shrunk back and given up the enterprise.
But I was not in that category. I was more
than ever determined to see the adventure to its end;
nay, to gain my own end in it too. The conditions
of the contest were at all events narrowing themselves
down to recognisable form. It was to be a trial of
strength mainly between myself and Slurk&mdash;between
an educated plucky Englishman, and a base German
ruffian&mdash;between one, moreover, who had right, moral
and legal, on his side, and love as his goal&mdash;and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
armed only with underhand cunning and terrorism,
and aiming at nothing higher than the extortion of
money. This was the way I read the situation, and
I flattered myself that I was equal to the emergency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon consideration, however, I decided to alter
my intention of asking Mr. Birchmore about his valet.
It was tolerably clear that he was not in a position to
give me any information; and besides, I had already
learnt everything except the particulars. Those
particulars, if I did not succeed in discovering them
unaided, must be extracted from Kate. She would
not withhold them from me, if I questioned her
resolutely and directly, enforcing my inquiries with
disclosure of the knowledge I had already obtained.
This then should be my next step. I sealed up my
letters, locked them in my desk, and, it being now
nearly seven o&rsquo;clock, I went down to supper.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;But at supper there was no Kate; Mr. Birchmore
and I were served by Christina, while the voices
of Slurk and our landlord could be heard in the
kitchen. My conversation was naturally somewhat
constrained; Mr. Birchmore had a good deal to
say about some excursion which he had in view
for the morrow, but I failed to pay very close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
attention to his remarks. Once, however, I caught
Christina&rsquo;s eyes fixed upon me, and smiled as I
remembered her warnings respecting the supposed
danger of solitary rambles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After supper I felt more restless than ever. Mr.
Birchmore brought out his invariable cigars, expecting
me to join him in a smoke; but I was not in the
mood for it, neither did I feel at ease in his company
until things should have begun to look a little more
comprehensible. I left him, therefore, and wandered
aimlessly about outside the house, exploring the
farmyard and buildings, and then coming round to
the road, and pacing up and down on a beat about a
quarter of a mile in length. It was a clear moonlight
night, and so warm as to be almost oppressive. At
length I returned to the house, it being then after
nine o&rsquo;clock. Mr. Birchmore had apparently retired;
Christina was nowhere to be seen; so I got a lamp
from my surly landlord, and found my way without
much difficulty to my own chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The warmth within doors was still more oppressive
than outside. I opened both the windows, drew up
my bed between them, and placed the table with the
lamp on it near the bed&rsquo;s head. I had previously
thrown off my coat and waistcoat, and laid them
across one end of the table. The diamonds were still
in the pocket of the coat; I intended taking them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
out before going to sleep, and putting them under my
pillow, or in some equally secure place. My revolver I
also placed beside the lamp. Then, having provided
myself with a book out of my trunk, and drawn the
bolt of the door, I reclined on the outside of the bed
and began to read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not, however, fix my mind upon the page.
First my attention and then my eyes would wander:
I took a futile and absurd interest in scrutinising all
the details of the room. I recollect them distinctly
now. The walls were not papered, but the plaster
was washed over with a dark gray tint, which rubbed
off on the fingers, and the uniformity of which was
relieved by vertical bands of dull red painted at
intervals of about five feet from floor to ceiling. The
ceiling was low&mdash;about eight feet from the floor&mdash;and
whitewashed. In one corner stood the china stove, a
glistening, pallid structure of plain tiles, built up four-square
nearly to the top of the room. On the side of
the room opposite the two windows and the bed was
fastened a tall looking-glass, formed of three plates
set one above the other, edge to edge, in such a
manner as painfully to cut up and distort whatever
was reflected in them. In front of the looking-glass
was a lilliputian washstand, and beside it a straight-legged
chair without rungs. In a word, a room more
utterly devoid of every kind of picturesque or ornamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
attraction could not be imagined; yet I could
not keep my eyes from vacantly traversing and retraversing
its vacancy. The door was behind me,
as I lay turned towards the little table on which the
lamp stood, but I could see the free edge of it brokenly
reflected in the mirror, with the cracked black porcelain
latch-handle and the iron bolt which I had shot into
its place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was anything but sleepy: the heat, and the pest
of midges and beetles which the light attracted in
through the windows, would have sufficed to keep me
awake even had my mind been at ease. In order to
disperse the insects I finally extinguished the lamp;
the moonlight in the room was so bright that I could
almost have seen to read by it. I closed the book,
however, and clasping my hands under my head, I
gave myself up to meditation. Not a sound of any
kind was audible except the muffled ticking of the
watch in my waistcoat pocket, and the faint rustle
of the pillow as I breathed. The white moonlight
seemed to augment the stillness; the whole great
night, and the house with it, seemed silently and
intently listening; and at length I found myself listening
intently too! For what? I could not tell; but
I listened nevertheless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By-and-by I fancied a sound came&mdash;a sound from
somewhere within the house. It was a very faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
sound, and did not come again; but it was such as
might have been caused by the light pressure of a
foot in one of the passages outside. Instinctively I
reached forth my hand and laid hold of my revolver;
but I did not rise from the bed nor otherwise alter my
position. I still lay as if asleep, with the revolver in
one hand, the other beneath my head, and my eyes
fixed upon the edge of the door, which was obscurely
visible in the mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Several minutes passed thus, and there was no
return of the noise. Then I saw the handle of the
door move and turn. The latch clicked slightly; the
door, bolted though it was, opened as if on oiled
hinges, admitting an indistinct figure in a long robe of
soft gray. So much I saw in the mirror. Then the
door was closed again, and the figure, advancing
towards the bed, ceased to be reflected in the glass.
It advanced close to the bed, and paused there a
moment; I could hear its deep regular breathing.
All this time I had not moved, but lay with my back
turned, feigning slumber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently the figure passed round the foot of the
bed and came up the other side. The full white light
of the moon fell upon it. It was Kate, as I had
known it was from the first moment she entered the
room. She was clad in a dressing-gown of soft flowing
material, which was fastened at the throat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
trailed on the ground. It had wide sleeves, one of
which fell back from the bare smooth arm and hand
that carried a lamp. The lamp was not lighted. Her
black hair hung down on her shoulders, and on each
side of her pale face. Her eyes were wide open, but
fixed and vacant. Her breathing was long and
measured, as of one sound asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She put the lamp down on the table beside mine,
and then stood quite still in the moonlight, her face
wholly expressionless and without motion. It was an
appalling thing to see her thus. I, too, remained
motionless, but it was because I knew not what to do.
To awaken her might bring on the worst consequences.
If she were not disturbed, she might possibly retire as
quietly and unconsciously as she had come. But the
mystery of her being there at all appeared utterly
inexplicable. What had led her, in her trance, to visit
my room? how had she ever known where it was?
What had she dreamt of doing here? and above all,
how had she contrived to enter through a bolted door
with as much ease as though she had been a spirit?
Perhaps this was but a spirit&mdash;or a phantom of my
own brain! Was I awake?</p>

<p>&ldquo;She stretched out her hand, not following its
motion with her eyes, but mechanically and as it were
involuntarily. She laid it on my coat&mdash;on the pocket
which contained the diamonds. Then, slowly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
deliberately, and still with averted face and eyes, and
that long-drawn, slumberous breathing, she unbuttoned
the fastenings one after one, and her soft tapering
fingers closed upon the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile my mind had been rapidly canvassing
all the pros and cons of action; and I had come to the
conclusion that it would be better for her that I should
interfere. Of my personal interest in the matter I
believe I did not think; indeed, knowing that the
diamonds would not be lost, there was no reason why
I should. But it would not do to risk compromising
Kate. It was dangerous enough that she should be
here at all; but that she should carry away the
diamonds with her was inadmissible. I rose from my
bed and laid my hand gently on her wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was no spirit, but warm flesh and blood.
For a few moments the restraint in which I held her
seemed to baffle and distress her; I fancied I could
feel her pulse beat under my fingers: a kind of spasm
crossed her face, her eyelids quivered and the eyes
moved in their sockets. Then her breathing became
irregular, and caught in her throat in a kind of sob.
The moment of her awakening was evidently at hand,
and I dreaded its coming, lest she should scream out
and rouse the house. But fortunately she uttered no
sound. Slowly speculation grew within her eyes; she
fixed them on me, first with an expression of strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
pleasure, soon changing to bewilderment and fear.
Then, with a cry that was none the less thrilling
because it was a whisper, she drooped forwards into
my arms. It was a delicious moment, for all its
peril.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are perfectly safe,&rsquo; I whispered in her ear;
&lsquo;only make no noise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tom,&rsquo; she said, suddenly freeing herself from my
arms, and putting a hand on either shoulder, while her
wild black eyes searched my face, &lsquo;you understand&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course I understand, my poor darling!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What shall I do&mdash;what shall I do? Let me kill
myself!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a motion swift as the glide of a serpent, she
reached towards the revolver, which I had left on the
bed. I was barely in time to catch her arm. The
look in the girl&rsquo;s face at that moment was terrible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me!&mdash;I will!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hush, Kate! You never shall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, what shall I do!&rsquo; she murmured again
slipping down on her knees and running both hands
through her thick black hair. &lsquo;Tom, if you loved me
you would kill me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kate, everyone in the house is asleep. You
can go back to your room, and no one know. Only
be calm.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And no one know? You think that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am sure of it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know better! Someone knows it now: he
made it happen!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t kneel there, dear. You&rsquo;re not yourself
yet. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying.&rsquo; I said
this reassuringly, but her words had inspired me with
a vague alarm that I ventured not to define. I brought
a chair and made her sit upon it, and sat down beside
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not here!&rsquo; she whispered, drawing back out of
the moonlight into the shadow. &lsquo;Come here, Tom.
He may be looking!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Kate, who can see us here? The door
is shut.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh&mdash;why was not the door bolted?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was. I can&rsquo;t conceive how you opened it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh the villain! how I hate him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kate, I love you, and whoever you hate must
have to do with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can do nothing&mdash;no one can do anything!&mdash;unless
you&rsquo;ll help me to kill him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whom? Do you mean Slurk?&mdash;tell me that!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; she answered with a shiver; not looking
me in the face, but with her hands clasped tight
between her knees. &lsquo;I do mean&mdash;him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now tell me all that he has done, dear,&rsquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
I, quietly. &lsquo;I must know everything; and then I
promise you that you shall be freed from him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is my master!&rsquo; she said, in a frightened
whisper. &lsquo;He has been so ever so long! He makes
me do what he will&mdash;he sent me here to-night. He
shames me and destroys me&mdash;he loves to do it! He
makes me sleep, and then I cannot help myself. I
wake, and find it done; and he has no mercy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why does he do this?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was when I was only a little girl that he
first got that power over me. He knew my father
was rich, and he wanted me to be promised to
him for his&mdash;wife, Tom. Then my father put me
in the convent, and I stayed there seven years, till
we thought he had lost the power, or was dead perhaps.
But he found me in America, and made me
come back; and now it&rsquo;s worse than ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t your father have him arrested and
imprisoned? It can be done.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh my poor father! He cannot, Tom; do not
ask me that!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must ask it, Kate. Remember, I love you!
Why is it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My father is afraid of him too,&rsquo; she said, chafing
one hand with the other with a piteous expression of
pain. &lsquo;If he did anything against him, he would be
ruined. My father cannot help me, Tom.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I do not understand. What has your father
done that he should be afraid of such a scoundrel as
Slurk?&rsquo; I demanded sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hesitated long before answering, moving her
hands and head restlessly and fetching many troubled
sighs. At last she laid her hand shrinkingly on mine,
and I grasped it firmly. &lsquo;I will tell you, Tom,&rsquo; she
said in a faltering voice; &lsquo;but you know I would tell
no one in the world but you. My dear papa did not
do wrong himself; but there were people connected
with him who did, and made the blame seem to be
his. And there were some papers of papa&rsquo;s which&mdash;which&mdash;oh&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, yes, I understand, darling; and Slurk stole
the papers?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;that is&mdash;no; it was worse than that, for
he didn&rsquo;t know where the papers were kept; no one
knew that but I. Tom, he made me sleep, and in
my sleep he made me go to the place where they
were, and take them out, and give them to him. He
made me rob my own father&mdash;put my own dear papa
in his hateful power. I would rather have died! And
papa forgave me&mdash;think of that!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then Slurk has the papers in his possession?
and he uses them for blackmail? But have you never
thought of trying to&mdash;it sounds badly, but it would be
perfectly justifiable&mdash;to steal them back again?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can do nothing. He can make me helpless by
a look; and he always carries them with him. But,
Tom, if it could be done without being found out, I
would tell papa to kill him. But I cannot let my
dear papa be hanged for that wretch; and, you see,
we have no evidence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good God! What a fearful thing it is!&rsquo; I
muttered. What help, what consolation could I
offer? A refined and sensitive girl under the mesmeric
control of a ruffian; her father subject to his
extortions and insults; and the only escape a worse
misery even than this&mdash;Kate to yield herself to him
in marriage! Faugh! the thought sickened me; but
it enraged me, too! Kate was right; death, sudden
and merciless, was the proper measure to be meted
out to Slurk. If he had appeared at that moment, I
believe I would have shot him unhesitatingly, and
rejoiced in the deed. Murder would be a righteous
work when wrought on such as he; and if the murder
were brought home to me, could I suffer in a better
cause?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate had risen slowly from her chair, and was
now fronting me, scanning my face and bearing with
curious eagerness. She held her hands across her
bosom, alternately interlacing the tips of the fingers
and pulling them free again. Her lips moved as
if in speech, but no sound came from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I got up presently, looking I daresay very solemn,
as indeed I felt. Her eyes followed mine as I rose;
and now we gazed straight at each other for some
moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I promised you that you should be freed,&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;and you shall be. I shall be sorry to have any
man&rsquo;s blood on my hands; but if you can be saved
in no other way, it must be so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You do love me, indeed!&rsquo; she murmured, with
a sort of sad exultation in her tone. But she added:
&lsquo;I cannot let you do it. I cannot lose you, even
to be freed from him. It is my father&rsquo;s fault, after
all. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I take it upon myself,&rsquo; interrupted I, with a
dignity which may have been absurd, but which did
not seem so to me at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But it would be murder&mdash;at any rate, the law
would call it so. No, you must not be called a
murderer, Tom. But I&mdash;they would not hang a
woman: let me do it! I should love to do it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she spoke with a look that confirmed the
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I could reply, however, her expression
changed again. She appeared to think intensely
for a few moments, and then her face lighted up.
Suddenly she caught my hand and kissed it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And kiss me, Tom!&rsquo; she cried, excitedly. &lsquo;Kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
me, for I deserve it! I have thought of a way that
will save us all!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much startled, and half fearing that the girl&rsquo;s
mind had given way under the pressure of trouble,
I was attempting to quiet her; but she silenced me
by an impetuous gesture, and went on speaking
eagerly and rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To-morrow we had planned to go to Kohlstein
for a picnic. It&rsquo;s a great, immense rock, where
robbers lived hundreds of years ago. Hardly anyone
ever goes there now. I have been there, and
I remember that on the top it is full of deep clefts
and holes; and I thought how, if anyone were to fall
into one, they might lie there for months without
being found; and they could never get out of themselves.
So now&mdash;listen! We will go up there&mdash;you
and I and&mdash;he; and I will lead him near the brink
of one of those clefts, and then you must rush forward
and take him, and drop him down&mdash;down to the
bottom! So we shall get what we want, and yet
there need be no murder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not be murder, Kate?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It need not be; for when he was safe down
there, rather than be left to starve, he would give
up those papers. Don&rsquo;t you think he would?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was trembling with excitement, and her
state communicated itself in some degree to me, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
that I was scarcely able to think coherently. But
there certainly seemed to be plausibility in her
scheme; at the worst, it would be better than shooting
the man outright. But would the recovery of
the papers put an end to Slurk&rsquo;s persecution of Kate
as well as of her father? Would not his power over
her remain?</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But we can have him imprisoned then, you see,&rsquo;
was her answer to my objection; &lsquo;and for fear of
that, he would never dare to trouble me again. He
would have been in prison long ago but for the
papers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It certainly seems a good plan,&rsquo; I said, after a
confused attempt to turn the matter over in my mind.
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll ask your father&rsquo;s opinion to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, he must know nothing of it!&rsquo; she exclaimed,
with a gesture of vehement dissent. &lsquo;He would betray
it. You don&rsquo;t know how&mdash;what a power that villain
has over him. Slurk treats him like a child when
they are alone. No, Tom; we must do it all ourselves,
or it will fail. Only when it is done will dear
papa get back his courage.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew more about how Mr. Birchmore was
treated by his valet in private than Kate was aware;
but I made no allusion to this. The more I reflected
upon the enterprise, the more inclined I was to assent
to it. It was wild, fantastic, unconventional; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
had important practical merits nevertheless. Moreover,
it possessed the powerful recommendation (as I
deemed it) of allowing for a fair man-to-man struggle
between Slurk and myself. I was to overpower him
by main strength; and from what I had observed
of the fellow, I fancied he would be able to make
resistance enough to save my self-respect. On
the other hand, he might be able to do more
than this; and if the worst came to the worst, of
course I might be compelled to maim him with my
revolver. But altogether, the prospect kindled my
imagination; I was stimulated by the thought of distinguishing
myself by my personal prowess before my
mistress&rsquo;s eyes, in conflict with her dastardly oppressor.
And as I looked at her standing there before me, so
lovely and so full of courageous fire, I said to myself
that no knight of yore ever did battle in the lists for a
worthier lady-love!</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, I realised that this was neither the
place nor the hour to enter upon a detailed discussion
of our plans. Every moment that Kate remained
with me increased her peril, especially if, as she
seemed to think was the case, Slurk had despatched
her thither. As to his motive in so doing, I had no
difficulty in forming an opinion. There was little
doubt that he meant to use her as an unconscious cat&rsquo;s-paw
to steal the diamonds, as, before, to purloin the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
papers compromising her father. Had I been asleep,
the device could hardly have failed of success. But as
Kate seemed herself not to suspect the real nature of
her involuntary errand, I would not additionally distress
her by alluding to it; it was enough that it
furnished me with a sufficient pretext, had others
been wanting, for inflicting chastisement on the valet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate said, in answer to my inquiry as to the proposed
time of our starting on the picnic expedition
the next day, that it would probably be about eleven
in the forenoon; we would, therefore, have ample
time to settle the particulars of our scheme before the
hour of action arrived. At parting, she clung to me
with peculiar tenderness; nor had I ever loved her so
well as that moment, when I looked forward to
liberating her for ever from the evil spell that had
been blighting her young life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After she had gone, I had the curiosity to
examine the bolt on the door. The explanation of
its mysterious opening proved simple enough. The
screws whereby the socket of the bolt had been
fastened to the door-frame had been removed, and
the holes so enlarged that they could be slipped in and
out without difficulty. Socket and screws had then
been replaced, so that the bolt could be shot as readily
as before. But the security was only an illusion; for,
the latch being turned, a slight push would bring away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the socket and screws attached to the bolt; and thus
the supposed means of safety be ingeniously used to
disguise the real absence thereof.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;It occurred to me next morning that, considering
the nature of the work that was cut out for me,
it might be prudent to depart from my usual custom
by leaving the diamonds at home in Christina&rsquo;s charge,
as she had herself suggested; and I took the earliest
opportunity of mentioning this proposal to Kate. To
my surprise she at once expressed a decided dissent
from the arrangement, and indeed seemed so much
perturbed by it, that I at once relinquished the idea.
But I begged her to tell me the reasons of her
objection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not now,&rsquo; she said hastily; &lsquo;I hear papa
coming; wait till after breakfast, and then you shall
know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were standing at the gate of the courtyard,
breathing the fresh morning air. She left me, and
returned to the house, whence Mr. Birchmore almost
immediately issued, and saluted me with more than
his usual cordiality. I wondered what his behaviour
would have been had he known of the transactions of
the past night, or of what was in store for us during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the day! He began to talk about Kohlstein, and
related several anecdotes of the bandits, by whom it
was said formerly to have been inhabited. &lsquo;I have
been up there more than once,&rsquo; he remarked, &lsquo;and the
traces of their occupation are still visible. I remember
one feature that particularly impressed me&mdash;a narrow
cleft or chasm of considerable depth, into which the
old fellows are said to have thrown their prisoners
when they became refractory.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Would the fall kill them?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should say not; the bottom seemed full of
chopped brushwood and other such rubbish. But no
human being could have got out unaided; and probably
a day or two&rsquo;s lonely sojourn there would bring
the most resolute malcontent to terms. It would be
a ghastly fate to fall in there, nowadays, and have
one&rsquo;s skeleton fished out again the following year,
perhaps, and a sensational paragraph in the newspapers.
You young folks must pick your steps
carefully to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Forewarned is forearmed!&rsquo; rejoined I, with
a short laugh. Further conversation was cut short
by a summons to breakfast. On this occasion Slurk
waited at table, and I observed him with more than
usual attention and toleration, as one with whom I was
so soon to try desperate conclusions. He was certainly
a villanous-looking character; but he appeared to be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
for reasons best known to himself, in excellent spirits
this morning; a circumstance which stirred up an
unwilling kind of compassion within me, reflecting
what a speedy and final end was going to be put
to all his possibilities of enjoyment. Vile though his
life had been, it was the only one he had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate likewise had the semblance of unusual
gaiety, but I could see that it was either feigned,
or the result of nervous excitement. And my judgment
was justified when, after breakfast, she overtook
me as I was on the way upstairs to my room to make
my final preparations, and said, in a voice unsteady
with emotion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tom dear, you asked me why you might not
leave your diamonds with Christina. You do not
know what danger you were in last night! On my
way back to my room I heard&mdash;two people talking
together, and they mentioned your name; so I
stopped and listened. One said: &ldquo;The bolt is all right:
I had better go in and risk it; he&rsquo;ll be certain to
be asleep by this time!&rdquo; And then the other said:
&ldquo;He has his revolver; leave it to me; he believes he
can trust me. To-morrow, when he goes out, I&rsquo;ll get
him to leave them with me for safety!&rdquo; and then they
both laughed. My darling, this house is a den of
thieves!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Were the persons you heard&mdash;who were they?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Christina, and that creature she calls her father.
Hush! there she comes. She must not see us
together;&rsquo; and in a moment Kate had glided away.
I went on up the stairs with a heavy heart. I would
almost rather not have heard this last revelation; my
confidence in my penetration had received a humiliating
shock. To think that Christina&rsquo;s innocent face
and modest maidenly air concealed the heart of a
thief, or, worse still, of a decoy-duck, was a blow to
my vanity as well as to my faith in human nature.
How artful she had been, when I fancied her most
ingenuous and kind! And then it all at once flashed
upon me&mdash;what if Heinrich Rudolph himself were in
the plot! what if he had written them to be on the
look-out for me! and what if Slurk, being secretly in
league with him, had contrived to get the Birchmores,
and me along with them, into the house, intending to
divide the spoil with Herr Rudolph and Christina!
Many signs seemed to point to this as a true deduction
from the circumstances; and even as I was
rather grimly considering the matter, a new confirmation
of Kate&rsquo;s discovery awaited me. Christina
was standing at my room door, and, as I came up,
she curtsied and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was wishing to speak a moment to Herr
Gainsborough, if he would permit me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; I asked somewhat roughly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Does the honoured Herr remember what I
said yesterday&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That you wished me to give you my diamonds
for safe keeping? Yes; and I have to answer, that
I am not quite so trustful as you seem to think!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scornful and severe tone in which I spoke
evidently startled her; but she still affected not
to understand. &lsquo;It was for Herr Gainsborough&rsquo;s own
sake&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; she began; but I interrupted her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you remember what <em>I</em> said yesterday?
that I went armed; well, I am armed to-day, and
whoever tries to teach me how to take care of my
diamonds may happen to get a bullet instead; so let
him beware. If Herr Rudolph is anxious about me,
you can tell him that!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Herr Gainsborough will be sorry to have
spoken so,&rsquo; said Christina, colouring deeply, and with
tremulous lip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am sorry to have to say it, Christina. But,
can you tell me how the bolt of this door came to
be in this condition?&rsquo; and I pulled out the loose
socket as I spoke, and the screws fell to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed I did not know this!&rsquo; exclaimed she;
but the dismay and confusion which were but too
plainly visible on her face belied her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will understand, however, that a house
whose fastenings are so much out of order would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
be a proper place to keep treasures in. Well, good-bye,
Christina. I am going to Kohlstein, and
probably I shan&rsquo;t spend another night here. When
you write to your brother in Paris, you may tell him
that the diamonds are quite safe, though they may
have been in danger.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will Herr Gainsborough let me say one
word?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too late&mdash;I have no time,&rsquo; returned I, with
an emphasis all the more coldly contemptuous
because of the secret inclination I felt&mdash;in view of
her youth and prettiness&mdash;to be compassionate and
forgiving; and perhaps I was half sorry that she
attempted no further self-vindication; but, obeying
my gesture of dismissal, passed out of the door and
down the passage, with her bare feet, and her blue
eyes downcast, and no backward glance. When she
was gone, I shut the door in no enviable mood, and
walked to and fro about my room like a surly bull in
a pound. For the first (though not for the last) time
I heartily cursed the diamonds; they seemed to raise
the devil wherever I carried them. In the midst of
my anathemas Mr. Birchmore knocked at the door,
and told me that everything was ready downstairs
for the start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And, by-the-bye, Gainsborough,&rsquo; he added, with
one of his point-blank, icy glances, &lsquo;I have arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
that our luggage shall be removed to-day; and if you
leave yours here, I advise you to seal it up in my
presence. I found the lock of my door in rather a
strange condition this morning. I have my own
opinion of what our landlord may be.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who recommended you to this place, Mr. Birchmore?&rsquo;
I demanded curtly; for I was getting to feel
something like contempt for my intended father-in-law.
It was not easy to respect a man who, under
whatever stress of circumstances, allows another man
to make a slave of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was that fellow Slurk; and he deserves a
good horsewhipping for it!&rsquo; replied Birchmore,
thrusting his hands resolutely into his pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think he deserves at least that,&rsquo; I rejoined with
a significant laugh; &lsquo;and whenever you&rsquo;re inclined to
operate on him, I&rsquo;ll stand by you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Birchmore said no more, and we went downstairs
in silence. Kate was already seated in the
carriage; Slurk was on the box, with a large basket
containing our provisions for the day beside him.
Mr. Birchmore and I took our places&mdash;one of us at
least with a heavy heart. The landlord stood at the
door and nodded us a surly farewell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where is Christina?&rsquo; I asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She has gone to the town to sell eggs: did the
Herr want anything?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should like to have sent for a screwdriver;
but probably I can get one on our way back,&rsquo; was my
answer; and with that we drove away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In about half an hour, proceeding by unfrequented
roads, we came in sight of Kohlstein. It
was a vast four-sided mass of gray rock, seamed with
deep clefts and fissures running horizontally and
vertically, so that it appeared to have been built of
gigantic blocks of stone. It was considerably over
one hundred feet in sheer height, and it stood upon
a rising ground of shifting sand. Slender trees grew
here and there out of the crevices of its headlong
sides, and straggled nakedly along its level summit,
outlined against the sky. It was an ideal place for
a robber stronghold; impregnable, certainly, to any
attack save that of the heaviest modern artillery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We must get out and walk from here,&rsquo; remarked
Mr. Birchmore. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s only one way of getting to
the top, and that&rsquo;s on the other side. I have got a
touch of my rheumatics to-day, and hardly think I
shall be able to do the climbing. However, that
needn&rsquo;t interfere with you young people, of course.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I exchanged a covert look with Kate as I helped
her to descend from the carriage; and she pressed
my hand and smiled. I admired her courage as
much as I lamented the apparent lack of it in her
father. The horse having been unharnessed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
tethered where some cool grass grew beside a stream,
we struck off across the sandy upland; Slurk carrying
the big basket, Mr. Birchmore walking with a
rather feeble step near him, and Kate and I in front.
It was an even hotter day than yesterday, and the
tramp was a wearisome one. By the time we arrived
at the foot of the Stein, we were quite ready to rest
a few minutes in the shadow of the rock, for coolness
and breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t do it!&rsquo; said Mr. Birchmore, wiping
his forehead and glancing hopelessly up at the narrow
white footpath that seemed to mount almost straight
upward to the distant summit. &lsquo;Just leave me here,
with a few sandwiches and a bottle of hock, and I
shall do very comfortably till you come back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was certainly very arduous work clambering
up that ladder-like path, and I doubt whether Kate&rsquo;s
determination and mine would have held out, had
the motive which urged us been merely one of
curiosity. But the top was gained at last, and we
threw ourselves down on the dry grass to rest
and to be fanned by the welcome breeze that
blew there. Slurk placed the basket in a little
hollow where some bushes kept off the direct rays
of the sun, and stretched himself at full length
beside it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, let us walk about,&rsquo; suggested Kate at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
length in an undertone; &lsquo;we must see what there is
to be seen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had already arranged all the steps by which
we were to proceed to the achievement of our purpose,
and we felt that the sooner it was ended now the
better. The surface on which we stood, though preserving
a general level, was full of irregularities and
unevennesses; it was overgrown with low bushes and
parched grass, with perhaps half-a-dozen starved and
meagre trees. Here and there the naked rock jutted
forth from the thin soil, crumbling and weatherworn,
its surface stained in places with dry lichens. The
entire table was scarcely two-thirds of an acre in area;
and a more forlorn and uncongenial spot, even in the
midst of summer, it would be hard to find. The cave
in which the robbers lived was somewhere lower
down; we had passed its entrance on our way up;
but it was here, probably, that an outlook was kept
over the country, to spy out the approach of victims
or of enemies. It struck me that it was hardly worth
while to be a bandit, if one must put up with such
bleak and unattractive quarters in which to carry on
the business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate and I wandered over this barren summit
hand in hand. The moment was now very near that
was to make a great change in the world for both of
us. We felt, somehow, as if we were taking leave of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
a certain part of our lives then. At least, I remember
gazing out across the wide expanse of sunlit country
that stretched far away on every side, and wondering
whether it would look the same an hour hence. Slurk
all the while lay beside his basket, and appeared to
be asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came to the brow of a sort of shelf or
shallow declivity, descending which we found ourselves
on a lower level by some six or seven feet;
and so much of the area as lay behind us ceased
to be visible. Advancing a few paces farther, we
paused abruptly on the edge of a dark, profound
cleft, which gaped right at our feet. It was so
narrow that one might easily leap across it at its
widest part; but it was so deep that, for all that I
could see, it might descend to the very base of the
Stein. Peering downwards earnestly, however, my
eyes, becoming accustomed to the gloom, could dimly
discern what seemed to be a bottom at a depth of not
more than twenty feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an awful thing to do, after all!&rsquo; I murmured
after a long inspection, looking up at Kate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you ready?&rsquo; was all her answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, shamed by her resolution. &lsquo;Let
him come.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She mounted the little ridge, and stood with her
graceful figure silhouetted against the blue heavens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
I, below, turned up the cuffs of my sleeves and
buttoned my coat across my chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Slurk!&rsquo; called she, in a clear penetrating tone,
&lsquo;bring the basket here, if you please. We mean to
take our luncheon on this side.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She remained standing there, with her back
towards me. From my lower position I could not see
whether Slurk were answering her summons with
alacrity or not; but since it would be his last opportunity
of obeying her orders, I was content to let him
take his time. By-and-by he appeared, with the
basket on his arm; he descended the ledge, and Kate
followed him, with her eyes on me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Set it down there, near the edge of this pit; not
quite so near, please. Now take hold of him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last words were spoken in a sharp, ringing
tone; and at the same moment the girl drew a long
knife from beneath the overskirt of her dress, and
stood with it in her hand. Surprised at her action, I
hesitated half an instant; in that half-instant Slurk
had thrown himself towards me and grasped me
round the body with his long powerful arms. Almost
simultaneously with his attack, I felt myself borne
down by a heavy weight from behind, and my arms
pinioned. The struggle for a minute or two was
tremendous, but I felt that I was overpowered. A
hand was pressing hard against my windpipe. Kate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
stood there with her knife, a new and strange
expression on her face; but she did not stir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length a panting voice close to my ear&mdash;a
voice which I knew well, and which, heard now, so
amazed me that I almost ceased to resist&mdash;said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got him safe here, Captain; have you got
his legs?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A grunt from Slurk intimated that he had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now then, Kittie,&rsquo; continued Mr. Birchmore;
&lsquo;be quick there, will you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kate came towards me with her knife. At that
sight I uttered a yell of animal rage, and made one
more desperate effort to be free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hold him tight, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Kate, in a
voice that I scarcely recognised as hers; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to hurt him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They mastered me; and then, with a rapidity
and deftness that showed the practised professional,
Kate made a circular cut through the breast of my
coat and drew out the diamonds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; remarked Birchmore. &lsquo;Now
the rope!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She went to the basket, and took from it a coil
of fine rope. The two men threw me upon my face,
and bound my arms and my feet securely. I made
little resistance, but submitted in sullen silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t forget his revolver,&rsquo; said Birchmore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
when this was done; and turning me over, they took
the weapon from my pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How do you feel now, young gentleman?&rsquo;
inquired the fellow, addressing me with a smile.
&lsquo;This is the result of plotting to throw unfortunate
valets into deep pits, and of flirting with strange
young women. I warned you, you remember, to
keep out of our way; but idle curiosity has been
your ruin. Kittie, put on the diamonds; he says
they become you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slurk grinned at this sally, but the girl said
moodily: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bother the boy, Jack; he behaved
like a gentleman all through; he&rsquo;d make a great
deal better husband than you do! Heigho!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Captain,&rsquo; continued Birchmore, addressing
Slurk in English, &lsquo;what are your orders? Shall we
lower away now, and be off? It&rsquo;s nearly half-past
one, and we&rsquo;ve a good distance to go before three.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Listen to me, Mr. Gainsborough,&rsquo; said Slurk,
also speaking in English, though with a foreign
accent; &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve got what we wanted out of you, and
we don&rsquo;t want to do you any more harm than is
necessary. But we must have time to get safe away,
and to do that we must allow twenty-four hours.
We shall leave you at the bottom of this pit, with
some provisions; and I shall loosen your arms enough
so that you can feed yourself. After we are safe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
I shall write to your friends at the farmhouse, who
are very honest persons I believe, and they will come
here and get you out. That is the best we can do
for you. Now then, Jack!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They loosed the cord a little round my arms;
then, taking it by the slack end, they lowered me into
that dark chasm until I rested at the bottom. Then I
saw Kate&rsquo;s face above the edge, between me and the
sky, with something wrapped up in paper in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s some sandwiches for you, my poor boy,&rsquo;
said she. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say good-bye to you in this
way, really! But I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d have me
now, even if Jack weren&rsquo;t my husband already.
Well, good-bye. Don&rsquo;t flirt too much with that silly
little Christina when you get out. There are the
sandwiches.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She let them fall beside me, nodded, and was
gone. I lay on my back, with nothing to look at
but the narrow strip of blue sky overhead. It was
quite cool where I lay, on a bed of sand and rubbish;
and it was still as death. I was buried alive to all
intents and purposes, and the chance of my ever
being disinterred rested upon a basis of probability
so narrow, that I judged it wisest not to hope. I lay
there, gazing up at the sky, and thinking over my
adventure; beginning at the beginning, with my
meeting with Birchmore at the hotel, and tracing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the progress of the conspiracy step by step to its
conclusion here. It was very ingenious, and very
well carried through. It had taught me a lesson that
I was likely to profit by, if I ever got out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long I lay there; probably
but a short time. All at once another face intervened
between me and the sky. It was not Kate&rsquo;s this
time; it was a very different one&mdash;Christina&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After peering anxiously downward for several
moments, she asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is Herr Gainsborough there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Herr is not badly hurt?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not a bit, Christina!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gott sei Dank!&rsquo; she exclaimed, heartily; and
adding: &lsquo;it is all well; you will be helped out
immediately,&rsquo; she vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon other faces appeared, with beards and
helmets&mdash;the faces of the &lsquo;Polizei.&rsquo; In a few minutes,
by the aid of ropes and stout arms, I was drawn up
once more to the light of day, blinking like an
awkward bat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before me stood nearly a dozen persons: a
squad of police-officers, with their swords and
carbines; Herr Rudolph and Christina; and three
prisoners&mdash;a woman and two men, whose faces were
unpleasantly familiar to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Some little official ceremony of identification,
and so forth, having been gone through with, we
all started for our various places of destination.
The trial took place not long afterwards in Dresden;
the prisoners were all convicted, and sentenced to&mdash;&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t care to remember what. They were a
dangerous gang of thieves, whom the police of several
countries had long been vainly endeavouring to
capture. But meanwhile, I went back to spend the
night at the farmhouse of Herr Rudolph. I need
not say that I scarcely had the courage to look him
and his daughter in the face. Herr Rudolph was a
most excellent and blameless person; and as for
Christina&mdash;&mdash;! I knew not in what terms to begin
my apologies to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appeared that my little friend Heinrich, in
Paris, had had his suspicions of the man calling
himself Birchmore from the first, and, in writing to
his father and sister, had mentioned as much. When,
therefore, the Birchmore party unexpectedly turned
up at the farmhouse, along with the owner of the
diamonds, a good deal of perturbation was created.
Afraid openly to warn me, in the absence of direct
evidence, Christina had done what she could indirectly
to excite suspicions in my mind. Failing in
this, the girl had actually gone down to Schandau,
on the evening of my interview with Kate in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
chamber, and laid her information at the police
bureau. The next morning she met the officers by
appointment at some distance from the house, and
they followed us to Kohlstein. After seeing the
whole party of us to the top of the Stein (Birchmore
followed a few minutes after myself and the others),
they formed a cordon at the foot of the path, and one
of their number went up to reconnoitre. Peeping
over the edge of the plateau, he saw Birchmore just
making his attack, and immediately signalled to
those below to approach. Thus it happened that the
thieves, as they were making off with their plunder,
found themselves confronted by an impassable cordon
of six loaded carbines. Resistance was out of the
question, and they surrendered at discretion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what can I do, Christina,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;to show
you how much I thank you? Of course I don&rsquo;t speak
of cancelling the obligation&mdash;that nothing could do;
but I should like to leave you something to&mdash;to
remind you that you saved my life and my diamonds.
Would you wear a diamond ring for me, or a pair
of earrings?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, many thanks, Herr Gainsborough,&rsquo; replied
the little maiden, gravely. &lsquo;You owe me nothing;
and as for diamonds, I shall never like them, since I
have seen them the cause of so much trouble and
danger.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But unless you let me do something, Christina,
I must think you refuse to forgive me for my inexcusable
impertinence and stupidity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looked down at her bare feet, and smoothed
her apron. &lsquo;Well, lieber Herr, I would not like
to have you think that, truly; I do forgive you with
all my heart; and just before you go away to-morrow&mdash;just
when you are ready to start&mdash;perhaps, if you
please, I will ask you for something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You shall have it, whatever it is!&rsquo; I
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, the next day, when the droschkey was at the
door, and my trunk packed and put on the box, I left
Herr Rudolph conversing with the driver, and went
back into the house to find Christina. She was
standing in a shadowy corner of the kitchen, so
absorbed in scouring plates that she did not appear
to notice me until I spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am come to say good-bye, and to claim your
promise, Christina.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She put down her plate, and blushed, with
downcast eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Herr Gainsborough will not be offended? it is
something I have no right to ask&mdash;only&mdash;it will show
I am not unforgiving&mdash;and&mdash;it would be better for
me than the diamonds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is it, dear Christina?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She looked up in my face, shyly and yet frankly,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kiss me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>This (as nearly as I can recollect it) is the story
told me by my friend Tom Gainsborough, as we sat
over a decanter of claret after one of his inimitable
little dinners. When it was over I gave a grunt, and
flung the but-end of my cigar into the grate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I don&rsquo;t understand about this
story,&rdquo; I then remarked; &ldquo;and it has misled me all
along. Your description of that creature, Kate&mdash;her
eyes and eyebrows, complexion, hands, and
nationality&mdash;all persuaded me it was the present
Mrs. Gainsborough. Yet it appears she was nothing
of the sort!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think not, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom,
laughing. &ldquo;They are as different, even in appearance,
as two straight-browed brunettes could possibly be.
It is not my fault if you were misled by a description&mdash;you
who know so well how incurably vague the
best descriptions are. Were you to see them side by
side, you would acknowledge that they are as little
alike as you and I are. As to the American part of
it&mdash;the truth is they were not really Americans at all:
Birchmore and the girl were French; and I in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
ignorance mistook their French accent for the
Yankee twang. When, several years later, I met
some real Americans&mdash;and married one of them&mdash;I
realised my error.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Well, I daresay you were not more
stupid than the majority of your countrymen would
have been in your place. But another thing&mdash;was
all that mesmeric business genuine, or a part of the
conspiracy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conspiracy, of course! It was the stock expedient
of the gang&mdash;and a very ingenious one, I
think; for of course the mesmerised one might turn
up anywhere, and if she were not discovered, well
and good; while if she were, all she had to say was
that she was in a mesmeric trance. As it happened,
the latter alternative occurred in both their attempts
on me; but I give the girl credit for turning it off
excellently well. In fact, she took a real artistic
interest in her business. You see, she had been
trained as a rope-dancer in her childhood, and afterwards
she was on the stage for a time. She certainly
had marvellous dramatic talent, and thoroughly enjoyed
&ldquo;taking a part.&rdquo; The realistic element that
entered into her performances no doubt rendered
them much more exciting than ordinary stage work,
and perhaps, sometimes, she almost deceived herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I should not wonder. Well, and what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the meaning of that confusion about the steamboat
and the train, and Birchmore&rsquo;s explanations?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mistake on their part&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Accidents
will happen, you know. I daresay my unexpected
questions disconcerted them greatly; but I was unsuspicious
enough, Heaven knows. What I admire
as much as anything in their management of the
affair was the skill with which they made me believe,
from the outset, that I was forcing my company upon
<em>them</em>, when in reality it was they who were leading me
round by the nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missus Gainsborough say de tea ready, sah!&rdquo;
said the sable servitor, opening the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up at once!&rdquo; I exclaimed, rising from
chair. &ldquo;I shall hereafter feel a new interest in looking
at Mrs. Gainsborough&rsquo;s diamonds!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE CHRISTMAS GUEST:<br />

<span class="f7">A MYTH.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">They</span> were ideal young people, and lived in a fairy
farmhouse, in the Eldorado of lovers. Everything
went happily with them; no troublesome grown-up
people thwarted or annoyed them; they could be
together as much as they liked, and had never in
their whole lives heard of such a thing as impropriety.
They had no enemies, nor so much as a
single friend with conscientious ideas of duty. In
spite of all this they were remarkably content with
each other and with the world at large, and never
did any wrong, to speak of, from week&rsquo;s end to
week&rsquo;s end. For the rest, they had lived and played
together ever since they could remember, had never
quarrelled except to provide a pretext for a reconciliation;
and she had always called him Eros, and
he had always called her Psyche. They loved each
other with all their hearts, and were a living refutation
of the folly of those who would persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
us that pain and struggle are the necessary discipline
of human beings. To see these two was enough to
make one believe in the feasibility of setting up a
new Garden of Eden on a durable basis.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their fanciful nicknames, and
exceptional surroundings and circumstances, Psyche
and Eros were as thoroughly human in their thoughts
and emotions as if they had lived in the most commonplace
of country villages, and, although they had
always been together, their temperaments were as
wide asunder as the poles. Psyche was imaginative,
dreamy, and sensitive to both mental and physical
impressions; her gentle brown eyes would fill with
tears at the lightest touch of pity or pathos, and the
delicate bloom in her cheeks would fade and her
girlish figure droop after but an hour&rsquo;s illness. Yet
she was entirely wholesome and healthy both in
mind and body, and though her voice was low and
soft, and her manner tender and appealing, she had
a strength and courage in the cause of right and
truth such as a son of Anak might have envied.
Eros, on the other hand, took practical views of life,
and prided himself upon his solid common sense.
Being now on the verge of his twenty-first birthday,
he affected a manly and dogmatic tone, as of one
who knew the world, and had arrived at the maturity
of his judgment. He was a red-cheeked, fair-haired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
blue-eyed youth; sturdy, vigorous, and jocund. Psyche
loved him devotedly, and took every occasion to
persuade herself that he was the wisest as well as the
dearest of mankind. But she could not help suspecting
sometimes that he was not always quite
amenable to reason, and would feel very guilty when
the conviction was occasionally forced upon her that
she had taken a higher view of this or that question
than he had. On the whole, however, she continued
to maintain the sense of her own inferiority unimpaired,
and the more inferior she felt the better was
she pleased.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that Eros would come of
age on Christmas Day; and as if the falling together
of these two celebrations were not enough, it had
been decided to enhance their joyfulness by the
addition of a third&mdash;which was to be neither more
nor less than the young people&rsquo;s wedding! Here,
surely, was bliss enough to be crowded into one
short twenty-four hours; and moreover, as Psyche
observed, looking into her lover&rsquo;s blue eyes with the
frank shyness of her own brown ones, &ldquo;What Christmas
present could we make to each other so appropriate
as the surrender of ourselves into each other&rsquo;s
keeping?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, this was bliss enough even for ideal young
people who lived in a fairy farmhouse in the Eldorado<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of lovers. Nevertheless&mdash;if it will be believed&mdash;even
this was not all! A fourth cause of rejoicing, and
one to which Eros and Psyche looked forward with
scarcely less delight than to their own near union,
was the promised advent of an old and intimate
friend of theirs, from whom they had been separated
many years, but whom they had never forgotten, or
ceased to reverence and love. He had been a young
man when they were children, and they had looked
upon him then, and did now, as a dear elder brother.
He had been their confidant and adviser, the unweariable
promoter and companion of their childish
merrymakings; a teller of splendid stories, a man
ardent, gay, sweet-tempered, wise. They had adored
him as only children can adore such a friend; all his
sayings were to them oracular, and all his doings
superhuman. They fancied&mdash;with cause or without,
it matters not&mdash;that but for him they would not even
have loved each other as they did. He had brought
out the best that was in them, and inspired that best
to become better. He had shown Psyche the manliness
that was in Eros, and had opened the eyes of
Eros to the rare loveliness of Psyche. What did
they not owe to him? And since he went away he
had become transfigured in their memories.</p>

<p>Nine years had he been absent, a missionary
among the heathen. But he had also travelled much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
in civilised lands, and had seen all manner of men
and customs. Meantime he had written scores of
delightful letters to the young friends who loved him&mdash;letters
which they read and re-read scores of times,
and thought more wonderful than his best stories in
the old days. Throughout this long period he had
never given up the purpose of seeing them again,
and, if possible, to part no more. But still the intended
meeting had been put off; for Mortimer&mdash;such
was his name&mdash;had so much work to do in illuminating
darkened souls, as to leave but a distant
hope of ever being able to indulge his own personal
desires. At length, however, the much-wished-for
opportunity had presented itself, and Mortimer was
really coming. A few days before Christmas the
young people received a letter from him, telling the
great news. This letter was addressed to Psyche,
who, as was her right, insisted upon having it all to
herself, and would not allow Eros to lay a finger on
it. She indeed vouchsafed to read it aloud to him,
but tantalised him by pretending to reserve certain
passages to herself; because, as she archly averred,
they contained secrets for her private ear. Eros, as
her future lord and master, was half disposed to take
umbrage at this exclusion, and, had the letter been
from any other being in the wide world except
Mortimer, there is no saying whether he might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
actually have been jealous! But since he was debarred
from jealousy, he solaced his discomfiture by
putting on an air of complacent indifference, stroking
his eyebrows with his forefinger, and twisting the
ends of an almost imperceptible moustache. Psyche
saw through his pretences, and knew that he was
annoyed, and she hated to annoy him. Why, then,
did she not hand him over the letter?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am on the point of setting sail,&rdquo; the letter ran,
&ldquo;and probably shall arrive soon after you receive
this. At all events, I am resolved to be with you on
Christmas Eve&mdash;your marriage eve! Death alone
can forestall me in that pleasure. I have said good-bye
to my barbarians, who were very sorry to lose
me, and fear that I shall never return to them. But
I will; and I mean to bring you two&mdash;or you one, as
you will be by that time&mdash;with me. Yes, my good
old people; for though your home is Eldorado, mine
is Paradise! Never was so beautiful a country&mdash;so
tender and serene a climate; such gentle-hearted
and Christian barbarians! It is a real Paradise,
large enough and lovely enough to tempt all good
souls to migrate thither; and I come forth into the
world to find colonists, and bring them back with
me. You will come, Psyche? and then I shall make
sure that Eros will follow you, sooner or later!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you are waiting for me to marry you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Well, I believe you are meant for each other, and I
will do what I may to render your union sacred and
perpetual. Not that I think mere earthly union is
always the highest good for those who love. You
know the old proverb; and there are lovers whose
hearts never quite realise one another&rsquo;s worth until
separation has taught it them. Do you love your old
friend, who used to go nutting, boating, snow-balling,
and story-telling with you, any the less because
you haven&rsquo;t seen him for nine years? And would
not you, Eros, love Psyche a thousand times better
were some chance to part you from her awhile? You
have never had her out of your sight, except when
your eyes were shut, and you don&rsquo;t half know how
dear she is to you. It would do you good were I to
take her with me to my Paradise, and leave you
behind. Until you know what it is to be alone, and
to see what you most want beyond your immediate
reach, you do not know everything. But perhaps
you will be content not to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this, and much more, did Psyche read to
Eros. But at the end of the letter there was a postscript,
having glanced at which she looked up towards
her lover with a sudden apprehension in her eyes.
His own happened to be averted; and after an instant&rsquo;s
hesitation, she folded up the letter and said,
&ldquo;The rest is a secret!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; returned Eros, yawning, and getting
up; &ldquo;no woman can be entirely happy without a
secret. Every man knows that; so I&rsquo;ll make you a
Christmas present of this one.&rdquo; And with that he
sauntered off, his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>When he was gone Psyche unfolded the letter
and read the postscript again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sail to-morrow,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;and am glad of it
on more accounts than one. It is a long overland
journey from my home to this port, and I did not
know until I got here that a strange and fatal
epidemic is wont to make its appearance in the
town about this time of year. During the last few
days it has broken out with great virulence, and
people are dying all around me. It kills in a few
hours, and gives no warning, save a passing chill.
Well, I have no fears; I have passed unharmed
through a hundred pestilences. Still, if I should fail
to sit by your fireside next Christmas Eve, do not
blame my will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear old Mort!&rdquo; Psyche murmured, tears
standing in her eyes. &ldquo;What if he had died, just
as he was on his way to meet us after all these
years! I won&rsquo;t tell Eros; no, not even if it makes
him angry. It&rsquo;s better he should be angry than
anxious. If anyone is to be anxious, let me be so.
Only if Mort doesn&rsquo;t come on Christmas Eve, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Eros must know. But he will come, I know; and
we shall all be happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It lacked scarcely three days to Christmas, and
the house had to be arranged and decorated for the
festivities. It was a house of a thousand to hold
merrymakings in, and seemed really to take a genial
interest in the preparations that were going forward,
and to give it all the assistance that was in its power.
Gray and weatherbeaten without, within it was warm
and home-like. Square oaken beams divided the
low ceilings of the rambling rooms; the deep fireplaces
were dusky with the smoke of ten thousand
fires; the mellow old kitchen was a world in itself;
and the shadowy bed-chambers, with their great four-post
bedsteads, were just the place to play hide-and-seek
in with ghosts and goblins. Moreover, the best
of feelings prevailed between the venerable mansion
and the natural and elemental surroundings amidst
which it had so long existed. The forest grouped
itself artistically in the background; the hillside
sloped lovingly towards it on the right; at a little
distance, a clear-eyed pond smiled placid goodwill.
And the rough spirits of Wind and Rain, Snow and
Frost, seemed to grow soft and tractable in their
sports with this time-honoured structure. &ldquo;Merry
Christmas!&rdquo; they whispered, wept, and glistened; and
the house glowed back a hearty response out of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
diamond-paned lattices, and its clustered chimney
breathed forth smoky satisfaction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Eros and Psyche laboured with all
their hearts and hands, and made the rooms green
with ivy, holly, and laurel. In the parlour, beneath
the cluster of mistletoe that hung from the ceiling,
was arranged a little platform, with a daÃ¯s, and an
altar-table covered with white samite. It was here
that the marriage ceremony was to take place. By
mid-day of Christmas Eve all the preparations were
complete, and the two lovers were sitting together
in the deep bay-window, half hidden by the ample
curtains, and head-over-ears in lovers&rsquo; talk. They
were big with the charming self-importance that
belongs to young people in their condition. Love
burned for them in the centre of all things&mdash;it
illumined, warmed, and perfumed the whole world.
For them the great earth turned more smoothly on
her axis, and moved in a fairer orbit; the setting sun
sank splendidly amidst his clouds for their sake; for
their delight yonder rosy-cheeked boy ploughed his
whistling way through the snow, and the sleigh-bells
jingled so merrily from the distant road. If only
Mortimer were there, their happiness would be complete.
And now he must arrive every moment, so
Eros kept saying, looking out of the window with
confident expectation; but Psyche scarcely replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Her soft little hands were cold and tremulous, and
the corners of her sweet lips drooped as she thought
of the secret that harboured in her breast. It was
the first secret she had ever kept from Eros. Oh that
it might resolve itself happily, and not&mdash;not as she
now began to dread! For evening was coming on
apace, and their friend had not yet come. He did
not come, though he had promised that Death only
should forestall him. As minute after minute slipped
by, Psyche felt an almost irresistible impulse to
snatch forth the letter from her bosom, where she
had hidden it, and give it to her lover, that he might
share and perhaps cheer her suspense. But she forebore;
she was strong enough to suffer alone, and she
felt, though hardly admitting it even to herself, that
Eros was not so strong in that kind of strength
as she. He would laugh at a blow from a fist
such as would knock her senseless, but the blows
of mental pain and disappointment he was but
ill-fitted to endure. Thus thinking, the gentle
Psyche crushed her trouble down, and even strove
to forget it, or believe it unfounded and imaginary,
if so she might answer her lover cheerfully, and
in no way cast a shadow upon his Christmas Eve.
But still that strange coldness crept at intervals
through her veins, making her hands and her voice
vibrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s quite dark already!&rdquo; exclaimed
Eros at length. &ldquo;Surely the man means to be
here by supper-time? I wonder how near he is
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may have been a delay. The snow is
very deep, you know, in some places. Perhaps
he won&rsquo;t find it possible to get here before to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! my dear little Psyche. You have forgotten
the kind of man that our Mort is. When he
says he&rsquo;ll do a thing, he does it&mdash;if he&rsquo;s alive. And
in that very letter of yours, which you make such a
mystery about, but which I know perfectly well has
nothing in it more than you read to me&mdash;he says in
that very letter that only Death would stand in the
way of his getting here to-night. And since he&rsquo;s a
man in perfect health and in the prime of life, I
don&rsquo;t see what doubt there can be that he&rsquo;ll keep
his word. Only I do wish he&rsquo;d told us the very
hour, so that we mightn&rsquo;t have had this suspense to
bother us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose we shall recognise his face
when he comes?&rdquo; asked Psyche, after a little
pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Recognise him? Of course we shall!&rdquo; returned
Eros, positively, as became his masculine superiority.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be considerably changed, to be sure; very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
likely he&rsquo;ll have a big black beard, and there&rsquo;ll be a
few lines across his forehead and round his eyes; but
you mustn&rsquo;t mind that. That sort of thing is bound
to come on a man as he grows old. I&rsquo;m beginning
to find that out myself; and Mort&mdash;why he&rsquo;s nearly
forty by this time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very wise he will be!&rdquo; murmured Psyche,
thoughtfully. &ldquo;He was the wisest person in the
world before he went away; we shall be almost
afraid of him now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as to that,&rdquo; said Eros, rubbing his downy
upper lip and smiling, &ldquo;as to that, my dear Psyche,
you must speak for yourself. Undoubtedly Mort,
the dear old fellow, has an immense deal of information,
and plenty of good sense to back it&mdash;which
is more than always happens, I can assure you.
But when a man reaches his majority, and is on the
point of becoming a family man into the bargain&mdash;give
me another, dear&mdash;&mdash;what was I going to say?
Oh, well, I don&rsquo;t think <em>I</em> shall be much afraid of him,
or of anybody else, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eros,&rdquo; whispered Psyche, feeling his strong
young arm round her, and his hand on hers, &ldquo;should
you be willing to have him take us back with
him to his Paradise, as he speaks of doing in the
letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, that must depend a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
upon circumstances. I shall talk with Mort, and see
what he has to say about his place. We mustn&rsquo;t
forget that we&rsquo;re very well situated as we are,
and ought not to move unless we&rsquo;re certain of
bettering ourselves. The sort of society he speaks
of might not suit us, you know; we&rsquo;re not missionaries,
and don&rsquo;t care about barbarians as such.
Mort, wise as he is, hasn&rsquo;t much practical sense in
some ways; not so much as&mdash;some men I know.
He&rsquo;s all for the loftiest and most ideal thing possible,
without reflecting whether or not it&rsquo;s inconvenient or
uncomfortable too. In short, unless his Paradise
turns out to be a finer place than I think it will, I
shall feel inclined to keep hold on what we have.
Besides, Psyche, any place that you are in will be
Paradise to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This compliment fairly merited the reward
which Eros immediately claimed and took for it,
and which, by its potent effect upon both giver and
receiver, made speech seem impertinent for a time.
Psyche sat gazing out across the darkened snow with
her tender brown eyes, and Eros looked fondly on
her, thinking that he loved her more than anything in
the world, and that life would be a blank without her.
Surely, were she to be taken from him, all his light
and warmth would depart along with her. That
passage in Mortimer&rsquo;s letter which suggested that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
might be well sometimes for lovers to be parted
had received his unqualified, though unuttered, disapproval.
Why should such a thing have been
written? Often, since Psyche had read it to him,
Eros had resolved to dismiss the idea from his mind;
but such is the perversity of human minds that the
idea remained in spite of him. It made him feel
now and then really almost uneasy. The feeling, of
course, was a morbid one; common sense and wholesome
reason forbade him to entertain it. Had he no
more confidence in Providence than to believe that it
would take his Psyche from him&mdash;his Psyche, who
had grown up with him from infancy? Would the
good God be so cruel as to deprive him&mdash;and at this
moment of all others&mdash;of the companionship of her
whom he so loved? But the misgiving was unworthy
of him. If he could not forget it, why then
he would face it, and face it down.</p>

<p>He bent towards Psyche, and discovered, by
some method known to lovers, that her eyes were
wet with tears. When Love is in supreme command,
the soul is more tenderly alive to various influences,
and hence more prone to sadness of a certain kind,
than at any other epoch of life. But Eros had
never understood Psyche&rsquo;s constitutional tendency
to melancholy, and just now he found it especially
inopportune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you unhappy?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we together, and haven&rsquo;t we everything we
want? And ought not this evening to be the most
joyful we ever yet spent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leaned her head on his shoulder, hiding a
sigh. &ldquo;I was wondering, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;whether,
when we go to the real Paradise, we shall meet and
know each other there as we do now. Do you believe
we shall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were few problems too profound for the
plummet of Eros&rsquo;s common sense to sound them.
&ldquo;Certainly we shall, my dear!&rdquo; he answered emphatically.
&ldquo;What put such a question into your
head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But shall you love me then? And shall I
be your own wife there, Eros, as I am to be
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t see the use, my dear little Psyche,
of bothering our heads with such gratuitous puzzles
as that. There&rsquo;s quite enough to attend to in this
life, without trying to guess what may happen to us
in the next. For my part, it&rsquo;s enough to know that
we love each other in the body, and are to be husband
and wife here in this farmhouse. There&rsquo;ll be time
enough to speculate about other states when we are
in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! but, Eros,&rdquo; said she, lifting her gentle face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
from his shoulder and looking in his eyes, &ldquo;suppose
that I were to die to-night&mdash;this very night, before
our wedding! Could you be content to wait&mdash;could
you rest satisfied with the love that we have already
loved in this world, and with the knowledge that I
was still loving you in Paradise, and would be yours
when you came there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eros felt an impulse of impatience, which he repressed
so far as not to give it words; but he turned
his face away. Those theories of delicate tissue and
transcendental application, which Psyche was given
to entertaining, irritated and silenced him. He loved
Psyche, as an honest man should love a woman&mdash;better
than any other man ever loved a woman, he
thought; and what more could be expected of him?
Besides, was it not being ungrateful for the blessings
in their possession to be borrowing trouble from an
improbable or unimaginable condition of things to
come? It was really too bad, thought Eros, and he
turned his face away and looked down the avenue,
leaving Psyche unanswered.</p>

<p>It would have been quite dark now but for the
whiteness of the snow. The wind was rising, and the
window-seat was getting chilly, and Psyche&rsquo;s hand,
which still lay in his own, was cold as ice, and she
herself seemed to shiver. The blinds must be closed,
and they would go back to the fire, for Mortimer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
might not come till midnight, for all they knew.
Stay!&mdash;what was that shadow moving this way up
the avenue? Was it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Psyche! Psyche! look!&rdquo; cried Eros, starting to
his feet in joyous excitement. &ldquo;That must be&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
it? Yes, it must be Mortimer&mdash;it is our dear old
Mort!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Eros, I believe it is!&rdquo; she answered, peering
tremulously through the darkness. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see
clearly; I had a vision of Death&mdash;that Death was
coming instead of him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Eros, with a laugh.
&ldquo;Let this be a lesson to you, my dear, not
to indulge in silly fancies again. But come
on! We must receive the dear fellow at the
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran into the hall, Psyche following, and flung
wide the heavy portal. A gust of icy wind burst in,
as though it had been lying in wait for them on the
threshold; and Psyche seemed to shrink away before
it, and Eros himself could scarce repress a shiver.
But they pressed forward again, and gazed out
earnestly on the night. Yes, there could be no doubt
about it now. There came their friend&mdash;he who was
most honoured and trusted by them both, yet who,
for nearly half their lives, had been a stranger to
them&mdash;there he came, striding swiftly towards them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
across the snow. Only a dark, lofty shape he seemed;
but the step, the bearing, were unmistakable; they
were Mortimer&rsquo;s own. By a simultaneous impulse
the two young lovers threw one arm round each
other, and extended the other to the advancing form.
They could not cry out in welcome. Was it their
great joy that silenced them? for joy will sometimes
bind the faculties like awe. It was very dark, and
neither had remembered to bring a light. Almost
before they were aware of it their strange friend was
standing close in front of them. How icy cold was
the wind!</p>

<p>In moments of high feeling and excitement we
do and say things as in a dream, and afterwards
hardly remember how we acted. So was it now with
Eros and Psyche. Did Mortimer take Eros&rsquo;s hand
in a grasp as soft and cold as snow? Did he kiss
Psyche&rsquo;s forehead with lips that sent a happy shudder
to her heart? Did he speak to them in mellow,
loving tones that sounded at once strange and
familiar? And did they answer him? Or was it
all a dream? Be that as it may, the spell soon
passed off, and they found themselves in clear possession
of their several senses once more. The
long-expected guest had crossed their threshold,
thrown aside his heavy cloak, and removed the soft
fur cap from his black hair, and, Eros leading the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
way, the three friends had entered the warm, firelit
parlour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, all of us!&rdquo; cried the host, rubbing
his hands together. &ldquo;Draw up to the fire, and get
warm, if you can. My stars, what a night! Psyche,
you look as if you&rsquo;d been kissed by an icicle; and
you, Mort, you are as cold as death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat down round the broad hearth, the guest
between the lovers; and as the firelight flickered over
them, so flickered and fell and rose again their conversation.
It often happens that, when we anticipate
saying most, we find the least to say; and somewhat
thus did it fall out in the present instance: or,
perhaps, because in a meeting like this, however
thoroughly foreshadowed and anticipated, there is
apt to be a good deal of strangeness and unexpected
diffidence to be overcome,&mdash;perhaps it was for this
reason that speech flowed but intermittently for
a while. Nevertheless, the lovers could feel that they
were every moment growing more and more into
sympathy and understanding with their new old
friend, and doing so even more speedily and completely
than might have been possible through the
uncertain medium of words. He diffused around
him, without effort, and apparently without being
conscious of it, a gentle and winning influence which
was fairly irresistible; so that by-and-by Psyche and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Eros fancied that never before had they known him
so well as now. At the same time, however, Psyche
was inwardly aware of a great, yet indescribable,
change from that Mortimer who had bidden her farewell
nine years before. The principle, the genius of
the man remained; but it existed now within the
sphere of such a mighty and grand personality as
transcended all she had previously known or conceived.
It was as if some beneficent angel had
stooped from heaven to visit them, and, lest his
celestial splendour should overwhelm them, had
assumed the guise and tone of that human being in
whom they felt the most affectionate trust. Through
his manner and aspect, and the low resounding
melody of his utterance, she seemed to catch glimpses
of a power and wisdom almost superhuman; but
blended with a deep kindliness and charity, and a
sublimity of nature that were more human than
humanity itself. She looked up to him, not in fear,
but with a loving, familiar kind of reverence; and
would have confided to him the choicest secrets of
her heart.</p>

<p>The influence that he exercised was not of that
kind which belongs to superior age. There was in
him all the fire and vigour of unquenchable youth.
His lofty figure was as alert and lightsome as it
was majestic. His manner was instinct with gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
sprightliness and playfulness, and it was impossible
not to feel cheery and hopeful in his company. The
curve of his lips, and ever and anon the sudden
kindling in his eyes, betrayed the fiery soul within;
yet in everything that he said or did were visible the
traces of a serene and absolute self-control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are glad you came in time,&rdquo; observed
Eros at last. &ldquo;We should never have got married,
I believe, if you had not been here to tie the
knot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; added Psyche, in her clear, subdued
voice, &ldquo;you will make it seem more beautiful and
indissoluble, and give it a deeper significance, than
anyone else could have done. Yes, I am glad you
came in time. Do you know, Eros, I did not think
Mortimer would come at all? That passage in the
letter that I did not read you spoke of a strange
pestilence, and immediately it came into my mind
that Mortimer was dead. And even now,&rdquo; she continued,
turning to the guest, and half-timidly meeting
his strong, unfathomable eyes with her own, &ldquo;even
now, though I see you here between us, I cannot feel
as if our Mortimer were in this world. Are you
really he? or a messenger come to tell us that he is
gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am alive&mdash;am I not?&rdquo; answered the guest,
with a particularly radiant smile; &ldquo;and if I am, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
your Mortimer is also. As to my getting here at
the right time, I am always sure to do that; it
would be a sad business, indeed, if I were not. But
are you both certain that you are glad to have me
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would not be merry Christmas if you were
not!&rdquo; exclaimed Eros, heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not always so well received,&rdquo; the other
resumed. &ldquo;I have been in all sorts of places, and
have met all sorts of people, and almost all have
called me abrupt and unceremonious. But then, not
many know me for what I really am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know you,&rdquo; said Psyche, after a pause;
&ldquo;and I cannot imagine myself so happy that your
coming would not make me happier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not fear to know me, Psyche,&rdquo; returned
the guest, with grave gentleness; &ldquo;and really
I am not so unsympathetic as I must often seem.
But I have a task in the world which brings me less
credit in the performance than in the after result.
Mankind, you know, Eros, are not always wise and
far-sighted enough to recognise at the moment what
is most for their good in the long run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that; but for my part I think I can
tell what I need more quickly and surely than most
people. For instance&mdash;that Psyche must be my wife,
and that you must make her so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You rate my powers too high,&rdquo; rejoined their
friend, smiling again. &ldquo;God only can make a man
and woman one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t trouble myself with such fine-drawn
distinctions. If you pronounce the service over us,
I will take the rest for granted. As I was telling
Psyche the other day, it&rsquo;s not worth while looking
beyond this world. If she is mine here, I&rsquo;ll risk our
getting separated hereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hereafter may not be far off,&rdquo; said the guest,
more gravely than he had yet spoken. &ldquo;You were
best not to leave it out of the account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death is my enemy&mdash;I can see no good in him!&rdquo;
declared Eros; &ldquo;and I will do the best I can to have
my happiness in spite of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; exclaimed Psyche to their
friend, in a low, appealing tone. &ldquo;He knows that
only Death can make Love immortal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must tell you,&rdquo; observed the guest, after a
pause, &ldquo;that I cannot stay here long; I shall be gone
to-night. What I came to do, therefore, must be
done soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night!&rdquo; cried Eros, in astonishment that was
half incredulous. Psyche said nothing, but hid her
face in her hands and shivered a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wished to make you happy&mdash;happier than
you have ever been&mdash;if you would let me,&rdquo; resumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the previous speaker. &ldquo;Whoever has lofty
beliefs will have a lofty fate. If your idea of marriage
is high enough, you will not hesitate to come
with me to my Paradise. How is it with you,
Eros?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Eros, laughing and shaking his
head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too far off, and the journey is too cold.
If you are really determined to leave us, you must
go without me. Surely you can&rsquo;t expect me to be
ready to start at such short notice? No, no! I mean
to stay by this comfortable fireside for a long time
yet, and so shall Psyche.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death has summoned men on shorter notice
than this,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Think again before you
decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have decided; and I never change my mind,&rdquo;
said Eros, obstinately.</p>

<p>And truly his preference was not an unnatural
one. The old parlour presented a most attractive
aspect. The great log which had been burning
on the broad hearth had now fallen into glowing
fragments, over which small yellow and bluish
flames danced intermittently. Everything was warm,
home-like, and familiar. Out of doors the stars
shone crisp and white, and the snow glistened pure
as a maiden&rsquo;s soul. But ah! it was so terribly cold;
the beauty of the prospect could be enjoyed much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
better from the genial vantage-ground of the
hearthstone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that is your decision, you must abide by it,&rdquo;
said the guest, and something in the words, and in
the manner they were uttered, awed Eros for the
moment. Then, turning to Psyche, he continued:
&ldquo;But even your Eros cannot choose for you. What
is your preference? Are you, too, willing to postpone
Paradise for the fireside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Psyche was naturally more imaginative than most
young girls, and possibly there was something in the
shadowy mystery of the hour, and in her own physical
and mental condition, that wrought upon her mood.
A creeping languor and a chill which the heat of the
embers could not counteract were gaining possession
of her, and filling her brain with weird fancies. Insensibly,
he who sat beside her, and whose icy lips
she had felt upon her brow, had become clothed to
her apprehension with an unearthly, superhuman
personality. No man was he, but an angel of tender
and mighty sway, stooping from heaven on the eve
of Christmas, to hold high argument with two mortal
lovers on those questions which most nearly concern
their welfare. As she spoke her voice sounded
faint and ethereal, while her eyes sought to penetrate
the shadow which had fallen over the face of
Eros.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pleasant here,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;yet if, in Paradise,
our union may be eternal and secure, it is surely
better to be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will meet Eros where we are going,&rdquo; returned
the strange friend, gently, taking her hand in
his own. &ldquo;If not this Eros whom you have known
here, then another and a worthier one than he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not another,&rdquo; whispered Psyche, entreatingly;
&ldquo;it must be this Eros&mdash;my own dear Eros
whom I have always loved. I have lived with him,
and our hearts are grown together. He is better and
nobler than he seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not for me to decide,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;But do you speak to him, Psyche. If he loves you,
he will lay your words to heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Psyche rose from her chair, and, stepping somewhat
feebly, crossed to where Eros sat, and stood
before him, her hands clasped. The room had become
more dusky, so that the three figures appeared
rather like shadows than beings of flesh and blood.
For a moment or two there was silence, and only
Psyche&rsquo;s beseeching attitude seemed to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eros,&rdquo; she said at length, &ldquo;I feel that I must go&mdash;I
must go with this friend of ours. Do you know
him, Eros? He is your friend as well as mine. You
might have gone with us; but that was not to be.
We shall not know marriage here, and we shall seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
to be separated for a time. But if your love for me
has been as great as mine for you, the memory of it,
and the faith in what is to come, will heal the
worst of the parting. Oh, my love, say it shall be
so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are crazy&mdash;both of you!&rdquo; cried Eros,
wrestling with the fear that beset him, and striving to
speak in an assured and masterful tone. &ldquo;What has
Mortimer to do with you, Psyche? You are mine,
and whoever pretends to take you from me is my
enemy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eros&mdash;Eros!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, with passionate
earnestness, &ldquo;it is you who are crazy, my
poor darling. Mortimer is dead; and the letter
which he wrote&mdash;the letter that I alone read and
touched&mdash;had in it the contagion of the pestilence.
It was the message of my death; and now my death
has come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death shall not have you!&rdquo; cried Eros, starting
to his feet; and such was the vehemence of
his rebellious anger that he felt ready to defy even
Omnipotence. &ldquo;What have I done that I should
lose you? I have loved you truly and faithfully&mdash;why
should not my love have its rightful fulfilment?
It shall not go for naught and end in dust and ashes!
As for this future you talk about, what is it? a misty
possibility&mdash;an indefinite surmise&mdash;nothing! I say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
it is unjust and tyrannical, and I will not submit!
Come to me, Psyche!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached towards her through the dusk, but she
seemed to falter backwards from him, and when he
would have followed, the tall form of the mysterious
guest rose between, and beneath that mighty and
majestic gaze the eyes of Eros wavered, though the
rebellion in him was unconquered still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must yield her to me,&rdquo; said those deep,
reverberating tones; &ldquo;yet it is not I that parts you.
True lovers can be parted only through want of
faith. Upon yourself alone, therefore, does it depend
whether she leaves you for a time or for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eros pressed his hands to his head. Every good
and evil impulse of his soul was in deadly struggle
for the mastery. Was his love greater than Death?
or had the past been a delusion? Was the future
to be a blank? He was but a man, with a man&rsquo;s
weaknesses. He must rise to higher levels through
bitter trial, if at all; and except there were in him
some elements of generous nobleness, to turn his
stubborn self-will at the crisis of the conflict, the
demon of mistrust would gain the victory. Had he
such allies?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak to him again, Psyche,&rdquo; murmured the
lofty presence, &ldquo;you may yet prevail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eros,&rdquo; she said, throwing all the tenderness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
her loving soul into the word, &ldquo;this is more than our
friend&mdash;he is our brother. Love and Death should
glorify each other. If they are enemies, Death becomes
cruel and Love degraded. Yield me up now
that you may possess me for ever. Oh, quick, my
love&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The struggling man uttered a cry, heartrending,
full of anguish. He was faint and giddy, and the
world seemed to reel beneath his feet. He stretched
out his arms. &ldquo;I love you, Psyche,&rdquo; he uttered. &ldquo;Do
not leave me behind; let me go with you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt her hand again within his own. &ldquo;You are
my own Eros,&rdquo; she whispered in his ear. &ldquo;I shall
not altogether leave you; you will see me in dreams,
and you will know that the Paradise I go to is near
this earthly home of ours. At last&mdash;perhaps not for
a long time&mdash;but at last we shall meet there. And
now ... take me to our marriage-altar, and let us
say farewell there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They came to the little samite-covered table,
Psyche supported between the other two. The lovers
knelt down together, and the form of the mysterious
guest bended beneficently above them. Then Psyche
slowly drooped sideways, and Eros caught her in his
arms. Yet no&mdash;she was not there!</p>

<p>Still kneeling, he looked upwards through the
window into the clear winter night, and saw where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
two cloud-shapes seemed to flit hand in hand across
the starlit purple of the heavens. A strange peace
entered his lately tortured soul. The doubt in his
love&rsquo;s immortality was gone, and the struggle was
ended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take her, friend!&rdquo; he cried, in a voice trembling
with a deeper than earthly happiness. &ldquo;So great is
my love, that not in this world, nor with this mortal
body, can I give it fit and full expression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was left alone in the old parlour, with the
dead embers of the fire upon the hearthstone. Christmas
bells were ushering in what was to have been his
wedding-day; but, like their sweet notes, his mortal
hopes had been caught up to heaven, but were not
lost there. It is many years since then, yet every
returning Christmas has found the same light of
peace in his face that first dawned there so long ago.
No brooding sullenness or failing faith has changed
it into gloom.</p>

<p>But who was the mysterious guest, and why did
he bear the likeness of him whom, above all others,
Eros and Psyche had loved? That is a question
which answers itself in all our lives. For when the
time comes&mdash;as come it must&mdash;that this majestic
Presence is met face to face, shall we not trust
that the countenance which will, perhaps, seem awful,
may at least not be as that of a stranger whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
we know not, and whose heart is indifferent towards
us? Would it not be pleasant, at that hour, to recognise
in him who must herald our entrance into a
new society, the well-known features of one whom
our previous life had made our most secure and
faithful friend?</p>
